<p>"If we look with wonder upon the great remains of human works, such
as the columns of Palmyra, broken in the midst of the desert; the temples
of P&aelig;stum, beautiful in the decay of twenty centuries; or the mutilated
fragments of Greek sculpture in the Acropolis of Athens, or in our own
museums, as proofs of the genius of artists, and power and riches of nations
now past away; with how much deeper feeling of admiration must we consider
those grand monuments of nature which mark the revolutions of the
Globe; continents broken into islands; one land produced, another destroyed;
the bottom of the ocean become a fertile soil; whole races of animals extinct,
and the bones and exuvi&aelig; of one class covered with the remains of another;
and upon the graves of past generations&mdash;the marble or rocky tombs, as it
were, of a former animated world&mdash;new generations rising, and order and
harmony established, and a system of life and beauty produced out of chaos
and death; proving the infinite power, wisdom, and goodness of the <span class="smcap">Great

<p class="caption2">PREFATORY NOTE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</p>

<p>The untimely Decease of the lamented <span class="smcap">Author</span> of
the "<span class="smcap">Medals of Creation</span>" during the progress of
the present edition through the press has unavoidably
delayed its publication.</p>

<p>The First Volume has been wholly rewritten by
the Author.</p>

<p>The materials of the Second Volume had been
elaborately revised and much enlarged by <span class="smcap">Dr. Mantell</span>
previously to his Decease. The <span class="smcap">Editor</span> has laboured
to carry out the intentions of the Author in rendering
this part of the Work as complete a compendium as
possible of the Pal&aelig;ontological history of the Organic
Beings of which it treats, and in adapting it to the
requirements of the Geological Student of the present
time.</p>

<p>The various sources from which pal&aelig;ontological and
zoological information has been derived have, for the
most part, been adverted to in the text or in the footnotes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"> viii </a></span>
The <span class="smcap">Editor</span>, however, has especially to
acknowledge the kindness of <span class="smcap">Mr. J. Morris</span>, F.G.S., in
allowing him to refer to the proof-sheets of the forth-coming
edition of his "Catalogue of British Fossils,"
and thereby affording him important assistance in
making correct statements of the distribution of the
Fossil Remains of the <span class="smcap">Crustacea</span>, <span class="smcap">Insecta</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Vertebrata</span>, in the strata of the <span class="smcap">British Islands</span>.</p>

<p class="caption2">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</p>

<p>In the first edition of the <span class="smcap">Wonders of Geology</span>, an intention
was expressed of immediately publishing, as a sequel to
those volumes, "<span class="smcap">First Lessons</span>," or an Introduction to the
Study of Petrifactions, for persons wholly unacquainted with
the nature of Fossil Remains; but the completion of the
contemplated work was unavoidably postponed, from year to
year, by the long and severe indisposition of the Author.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile several works professing the same
object have issued from the press; and an enlarged edition
of Sir C. Lyell's "<span class="smcap">Elements</span>" has also appeared, in which
the elementary principles of physical Geology are fully illustrated,
and numerous figures given of the characteristic
fossils of the several formations, or groups of strata. But
that department of the science which especially treats of
Organic Remains is necessarily considered in a cursory
manner; and a work upon the plan originally contemplated
by the Author seems still to be required, to initiate the
young and uninstructed in the study of those Medals of
Creation&mdash;those electrotypes of nature&mdash;the mineralized
remains of the plants and animals which successively
flourished in the earlier ages of our planet, in periods
incalculably remote, and long antecedent to all human
history and tradition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"> x </a></span></p>

<p>With this conviction the present volumes are offered, with
such modifications of the original plan as circumstances have
rendered necessary, as a guide for the Student and the
Amateur Collector of fossil remains; for the intelligent
Observer who may desire to possess a general knowledge of
the subject, without intending to pursue Geology as a science;
and for the Tourist who may wish, in the course of his
travels, to employ profitably a leisure hour in quest of those
interesting memorials of the ancient physical revolutions
of our globe, which he will find everywhere presented to his
observation.</p>

<p class="caption2">ADDRESS TO THE READER.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Some books are to be tasted&mdash;others to be swallowed&mdash;and some few
to be chewed and digested; that is, some Books are to be read only in
parts&mdash;others to be read, but not curiously&mdash;and some few to be read
wholly and with diligence and attention."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lord Bacon's Essays</span>.</p>
</div>


<p>Anxious that the "<span class="smcap">Courteous Reader</span>" should derive
from this work all the information it is designed to impart,
the Author presumes to offer a few words in explanation of
the plan upon which it has been constructed, and some
suggestions as to the best means of rendering its contents
most available to the varied tastes and pursuits of different
classes of readers.</p>

<p>In its arrangement, a three-fold object was had in view;
namely, in the first place, to present such an epitome of
<span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;ontology</span>, the science which treats of the fossil remains
of the ancient inhabitants of the Globe, as shall enable the
intelligent Observer to comprehend the nature of the principal
discoveries in modern Geology, and the method of investigation
by which such highly interesting, and unexpected
results, have been obtained..</p>

<p>Secondly, to assist the <span class="smcap">Collector</span> in his search for Organic
Remains,&mdash;directing attention to those objects which possess
the highest interest, and are especially deserving of accurate
examination&mdash;instructing him in the art of developing and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"> xii </a></span>
preserving the specimens he may discover&mdash;and pointing out
the means to be pursued, for ascertaining their nature, and
their relation to existing plants or animals.</p>

<p>Thirdly, to place before the <span class="smcap">Student</span> a familiar exposition
of the elementary principles of Pal&aelig;ontology, based upon
a general knowledge of the structure of vegetable and animal
organization; to excite in his mind a desire for further
information, and prepare him for the perusal and study of
works of a higher order than these unpretending volumes;
and to point out the sources from which the required
instruction may be derived.</p>

<p>Although fully aware of the imperfect manner in which
these intentions are fulfilled, the Author hopes that the
indulgence claimed by one of the most able writers of our
times may be extended to him; and that, "if the design be
good upon the whole, the work will not be censured too
severely for those faults, from which, in parts, its very nature
would scarcely allow it to be free."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Sir E. B. Lytton&mdash;preface to the second edition of "<span class="smcap">The Disowned.</span>"</p></div>

<p>With regard to the best means of making use of these
volumes, the advice of the great founder of Inductive Philosophy,
on the Study of Books in general, expressed in the
quotation prefixed to this address, is peculiarly applicable
to the different classes of readers for whom the work is
designed.</p>

<p>Thus, "<i>the Book may be tasted, that is, read only in parts</i>,"
by the intelligent reader, who requires but a general acquaintance
with the subjects it embraces. The perusal of the
introductory and concluding remarks of each chapter, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"> xiii </a></span>
general descriptions of fossil remains, and of the circumstances
under which they occur,&mdash;omitting the scientific
terms and descriptions,&mdash;and a cursory examination of the
illustrations, will probably satisfy his curiosity; and the
work may be transferred to the library for occasional reference,
or taken as a travelling companion and guide to some
interesting geological district.</p>

<p>But the Book "<i>must be swallowed, that is, read, but not
curiously</i>," by the reader desirous of forming a collection of
organic remains. A general acquaintance with its contents,
and a careful investigation of the characters of the fossils,
and comparison with the figures and descriptions, will be
requisite to enable the amateur collector to determine the
nature of the specimens he may discover.</p>

<p>By the <span class="smcap">Student</span> the Book "<i>must be digested, that is, read
wholly, and with diligence and attention</i>." He should fully
comprehend one subject before he advances to the consideration
of another, and should test the solidity of his knowledge
by practical research. He should visit some of the localities
described; collect specimens, and develope them with his
own hands; examine their structure microscopically; nor
rest satisfied until he has determined their general characters,
and ascertained their generic and specific relations. Nor is
this an arduous or irksome task; by a moderate degree of
attention, a mind of average ability may quickly overcome
the apparent difficulties, and will find in the knowledge thus
acquired, and in the accession of mental vigour which such
investigations never fail to impart, an ample reward for any
expenditure of time and trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"> xiv </a></span></p>

<p>It is, indeed, within the power of every intelligent reader,
by assiduity and perseverance, to attain the high privilege of
those who walk in the midst of wonders, in circumstances
where the uninformed and uninquiring eye can perceive
neither novelty nor beauty; and of being</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Geology</span>, in the magnitude and sublimity of the objects
of which it treats, ranks next to <span class="smcap">Astronomy</span> in the scale of
the Sciences."&mdash;<i>Sir J. F. W. Herschel.</i></p>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Geology</span>, a term signifying a discourse on the Earth,
(from two Greek words: viz. &#947;&#7969;, <i>ge</i>, the earth; and &#955;&#8001;&#947;&#959;&#962;,
<i>logos</i>, a discourse,) is the science which treats of the physical
structure of the planet on which we live, and of the
nature and causes of the successive changes which have
taken place in the organic and inorganic kingdoms, from
the remotest period to the present time, and is therefore
intimately connected with every department of natural
philosophy.</p>

<p>While in common with other scientific pursuits it yields
the noblest and purest pleasures of which the human mind is
susceptible, it has peculiar claims on our attention, since it
offers inexhaustible and varied fields of intellectual research,
and its cultivation, beyond that of any other science, is in
a great measure independent of external circumstances; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"> 2 </a></span>
it can be followed in whatever condition of life we maybe
placed, and wherever our fortunes may lead us.</p>

<p>The eulogium passed by a distinguished living philosopher
on scientific knowledge in general, is strikingly applicable
to geological investigations. "The highest worldly-prosperity,
so far from being incompatible with them, supplies
additional advantages for their pursuit; they may be
alike enjoyed in the intervals of the most active business,
while the calm and dispassionate interest with which they
fill the mind, renders them a most delightful retreat from
the agitations and dissensions of the world, and from the
conflict of passions, prejudices, and interests, in which the
man of business finds himself continually involved."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

Philosophy."</p></div>

<p>From the present advanced state of geological science,
particularly of that department which it is the more especial
object of these volumes to elucidate, namely <span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;ontology</span>,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
or the study of Organic Remains,&mdash;it seems
scarcely credible, that but little more than a century ago
it was a matter of serious question with naturalists, whether
the petrified shells imbedded in the rocks and strata were
indeed shells that had been secreted by molluscous animals;
or whether these bodies, together with the teeth, bones,
leaves, wood, &amp;c. found in a fossil state, were not formed
by what was then termed the plastic power of the earth;
in like manner as minerals, metals, and crystals.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Pal&aelig;ontology: from &#960;&#945;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;, <i>palaios</i>, ancient&mdash;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;, <i>onta</i>, beings&mdash;&#955;&#8001;&#947;&#959;&#962;,
<i>logos</i>, a discourse.</p></div>

<p>In a "Natural History of England," published towards
the end of the last century, it is gravely observed that
at Bethersden in Kent, a kind of stone is found full of
shells, "<i>which is a proof that shells and the animals we
find in them living, have no necessary connexion</i>." Another
amusing instance of the ignorance on such subjects which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"> 3 </a></span>
prevailed at no remote period, occurs in a "History of the
County of Surrey," in which it is stated that in a search
for coal near Guildford the borers broke, and "this was
thought by Mr. Peter Lely, the Astrologer, to have been
the work of subterranean spirits, who wrenched off the
augers of the miners, lest their secret haunts should be
invaded."</p>

<p>But in the latter part of the seventeenth century, there
were several eminent men in England who were greatly in
advance of the age in which they lived, and strenuously
exerted themselves to discover and promulgate the true principles
of Geology. Among these, Dr. <span class="smcap">Martin Lister</span>, physician
to Queen Anne, was one of the most distinguished.
This accomplished naturalist, in his great work on shells,
which remains to this day a splendid monument of his
labours, and of the talents and filial affection of his two
daughters, by whom all the plates were engraved, figures
and describes many fossil shells as real animal productions,
and carefully compares them with recent species. He also
recognised the distinction of strata by the organic remains
they contain; and to him the honour is due of having first
suggested the construction of geological maps;<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> he was
likewise well acquainted with the position and extent of the
Chalk and other strata of the South of England.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_5" id="Footnote_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> This celebrated physician and British geologist died in 1712,

Chapel.</p></div>

<p>From the foreign writers, who at an early period had obtained
some correct notions of the structure of our planet,
and of the nature of the revolutions it had undergone, I select
the following beautiful and philosophical illustration of the
physical mutations to which the surface of the earth is perpetually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"> 4 </a></span>
subjected. It is from an Arabic manuscript of the
thirteenth century;<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the narrative is supposed to be related
by Rhidhz, an allegorical personage.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6" id="Footnote_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Quoted by Sir C. Lyell in his "Principles of Geology."</p></div>

<p class="smaller">"I passed one day by a very ancient and populous city, and
I asked one of its inhabitants how long it had been founded? 'It is,
indeed, a mighty city,' replied he; 'we know not how long it has
existed, and our ancestors were on this subject as ignorant as ourselves.'
Some centuries afterwards I passed by the same place, but
I could not perceive the slightest vestige of the city; and I demanded
of a peasant, who was gathering herbs upon its former site, how long
it had been destroyed? 'In sooth, a strange question,' replied he,
'the ground here has never been different from what you now behold
it.' 'Was there not,' said I, 'of old a splendid city here?' 'Never,'
answered he, 'so far as we know, and never did our fathers speak to
us of any such.'</p>

<p class="smaller">"On revisiting the spot, after the lapse of other centuries, I found
the sea in the same place, and on its shores were a party of fishermen,
of whom I asked how long the land had been covered by the
waters? 'Is this a question,' said they, 'for a man like you? this
spot has always been what it is now.'</p>

<p class="smaller">"I again returned ages afterwards, and the sea had disappeared.
I inquired of a man who stood alone upon the ground, how long ago
the change had taken place, and he gave me the same answer that
I had received before.</p>

<p class="smaller">"Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I
found there a flourishing city, more populous and more rich in buildings
than the city I had seen the first time; and when I fain would
have informed myself regarding its origin, the inhabitants answered
me, 'Its rise is lost in remote antiquity&mdash;we are ignorant how long
it has existed, and our fathers were on this subject no wiser than
ourselves.'"</p>

<p>We may smile at the ignorance of the inhabitants of the
fabled cities, but are we in a condition to give a more satisfactory
reply should it be inquired of us, "What are the
physical changes which the country you inhabit has undergone?"&mdash;and
yet cautious observation, and patient and
unprejudiced investigation, are alone necessary to enable us
to answer the interrogation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"> 5 </a></span></p>

<p>Dismissing from his mind all preconceived opinions, the
student must be prepared to learn that the earth's surface
has been, and still is, subject to perpetual mutation,&mdash;that
the sea and land are continually changing place,&mdash;that what
is now dry land was once the bottom of the deep, and that
the bed of the present ocean will, in its turn, be elevated
above the water and become land,&mdash;that all the solid materials
of the globe have been in a softened, fluid, or gaseous
state,&mdash;that the relics of countless myriads of animals and
plants are entombed in the rocks and strata,&mdash;and that
vast mountain-chains, and extensive regions, are wholly
composed of the petrified remains of beings that lived and
died in periods long antecedent to the creation of the human
race. Astounding as are these propositions, they rest upon
evidence so clear and incontrovertible, that they cannot fail
to be admitted by every intelligent and unprejudiced reader,
who will bestow but a moderate share of attention to the
examination of the phenomena, of which the following pages
present a familiar exposition.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude these introductory observations, without
adverting to the incalculable benefits which result from
scientific pursuits in general, and of Geology in particular.
An able modern writer has justly remarked:&mdash;"It is fearfully
true, that nine-tenths of the immorality which pervades
the better classes of society, originate from the want of an
interesting occupation to fill up the vacant time; and as
the study of the natural sciences is as attractive as it is
beneficial, it must necessarily exert a moral and even
religious influence upon the young and inquiring mind.
The youth who is fond of scientific pursuits will not enter
into revelry, for frivolous or vicious excitements will have
no fascination for him. The overflowing cup, the unmeaning
or dishonest game, will not entice him. If any one doubts
the beneficial influence of these studies on the morals and
character, I would ask him to point out the immoral young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"> 6 </a></span>
man who is devotedly attached to any branch of natural
science: I never knew such an one. There may be such
individuals&mdash;for religion only can change the heart&mdash;but if
there be, they are very rare exceptions; and the loud
clamours which are always raised against the man of science
who errs, prove how rarely the study of the works of the
Creator fails to exert an ennobling effect upon a well-regulated
mind. Fortunate, indeed, are the youth of either sex,
who early imbibe a taste for natural knowledge, and whose
predilections are not thwarted by injudicious friends."</p>

<p>And while Geology exerts this hallowing influence on the
character, it possesses the great advantage of presenting
subjects adapted to every capacity; on some of its investigations
the highest intellectual powers and the most profound
acquirements in exact science are required; while
many of its problems may be solved by any one who has
eyes and will use them; and innumerable facts illustrative
of the ancient condition of our planet, and of its inhabitants,
may be gathered by any diligent and intelligent
observer.</p>

<p>But it is surely unnecessary to dwell on the interest and
importance of a study, which instructs us that every pebble
we tread upon bears the impress of the Almighty's hand,
and affords evidence of Creative wisdom; that every grain
of sand, every particle of dust scattered by the wind, may
be composed of the aggregated skeletons of beings, so
minute as to elude our unassisted vision, but which possessed
an organization as marvellous as our own;&mdash;a science
whose discoveries have realized the wildest imaginings of the
poet,&mdash;whose realities far surpass in grandeur and sublimity
the most imposing fictions of romance;&mdash;a science, whose
empire is the earth, the ocean, the atmosphere, the heavens;&mdash;whose
speculations embrace all elements, all space, all
time;&mdash;objects the most minute, objects the most colossal;&mdash;carrying
its researches into the smallest atom which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"> 7 </a></span>
microscope can render accessible to our visual organs,&mdash;and
comprehending all the phenomena in the boundless Universe,
which the powers of the telescope can reveal.</p>

<p>And as no branch of natural philosophy can more strongly
impress the mind with that deep sense of humility and
dependence, which the contemplation of the works of the
Eternal is calculated to inspire, so none can more powerfully
encourage our aspirations after truth and wisdom.
Every walk we take offers subjects for profound meditation,&mdash;every
pebble that attracts our notice, matter for serious
reflection; and contemplating the incessant dissolution and
renovation which are taking place around us in the organic
and inorganic kingdoms of nature, we are struck with the
force and beauty of the exclamation of the poet&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the view of economizing space, I would refer the reader
to the following volumes for figures and descriptions of such
fossils as are illustrated therein: by this arrangement I hope
to afford the student a comprehensive view of Pal&aelig;ontology,

every good public or private library in the kingdom, it will
be accessible to most of my readers.</p>

<p>II. <i>The Wonders of Geology, or a Familiar Exposition of
Geological Phenomena</i>; <i>sixth</i> edition, in two vols, with
coloured plates, and numerous figures; by the <span class="smcap">Author</span>.

<p>A good geological map of Great Britain is indispensable.
The small map published by the Society for the Diffusion
of Useful Knowledge, edited by Sir R. Murchison, price 5<i>s.</i>,
is an excellent compendium; but Mr. Knipe's large "<i>Geological
Map of the British Isles</i>" is the most complete and
convenient for the traveller: price 3<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> By reference to
the map, the geological structure, and the prevailing fossils

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> solid materials of which the earth is composed, from
the surface to the greatest depths within the reach of human
observation, consist of minerals and fossils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minerals</span> are inorganic substances formed by natural
operations, and are the product of chemical or electro-chemical
action.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossils</span> are the durable remains of animals and vegetables
which have been imbedded in the strata by natural causes
in remote periods, and subsequently more or less altered in
structure and composition by mechanical and chemical
agencies.</p>

<p>The soft and delicate parts of animal and vegetable organisms
rapidly decompose after death; but the firmer and
denser structures, such as the bones and teeth of the former,
and the woody fibre of the latter, possess considerable durability,
and under certain conditions will resist decay for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"> 16 </a></span>
many years, or even centuries; and when deeply imbedded
in the earth, protected from atmospheric influences, and
subjected to the conservative effects of various mineral
solutions, the most perishable tissues often resist decomposition,
and becoming transformed into stone, may endure
for incalculable periods of time. The calcareous and siliceous
cases or frustules of numerous microscopic plants are
so indestructible, and occur in such inconceivable quantities,
that the belief of some eminent naturalists of the
last century, that every grain of flint and lime in certain
rocks, may have been elaborated by the energies of vitality,
can no longer be regarded as an extravagant hypothesis.
Some idea may be formed of the large proportion of the
solid materials of the globe that has unquestionably originated
from this source, by a reference to the list of strata
which are wholly, or in great part, composed of animal
and vegetable structures, given in the "Wonders of
Geology," p. 888.</p>

<p>There are also immense tracts of country that consist
in a great measure of the remains of plants in the state of
anthracite, coal, lignite, &amp;c.; and districts covered with
peat-bogs and subterranean forests.</p>

<p>Although these relics of animal and vegetable organisms
are found in almost every sedimentary deposit, yet they
occur far more abundantly, and in a better state of preservation,
in some strata than in others: nor are they equally
distributed throughout the same bed, but are heaped together
in particular localities, and occur but sparingly, or are
altogether absent, in other layers of the same rock. Neither
are the remains of the same kinds of animals and plants
found indiscriminately in strata of different ages: on the
contrary, many species are restricted to the most ancient,
others to the most recent formations; while some genera
range through the entire series of deposits, and also appear
as denizens of the existing seas. Hence organic remains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"> 17 </a></span>
acquire a high degree of importance, not only from the
intrinsic interest they possess as objects of natural history,
but also for the light they shed on the physical condition of
our planet in the remotest ages, and for the data they afford
as to the successive physical revolutions which the surface
of the earth has undergone.</p>

<p>Fossils have been eloquently and appropriately termed
<span class="smcap">Medals of Creation</span>; for as an accomplished numismatist,
even when the inscription of an ancient and unknown coin
is illegible, can from the half-obliterated effigy, and from
the style of art, determine with precision the people by
whom, and the period when, it was struck; in like manner
the geologist can decipher these natural memorials, interpret
the hieroglyphics with which they are inscribed, and from
apparently the most insignificant relics, trace the history of
beings of whom no other records are extant, and ascertain
the forms and habits of unknown types of organization whose
races were swept from the face of the earth, ere the creation
of man and the creatures which are his contemporaries.
Well might the illustrious Bergman exclaim, "<i>Sunt instar
nummorum memorialium, qu&aelig; de pr&aelig;teritis globi nostri fatis
testantur, ubi omnia silent monumenta historica</i>."</p>

<p>To derive from these Medals of Creation all the information
they are capable of affording, regard therefore must
be had not only to their peculiar characters, but also to the
geological relations of the strata in which they are imbedded.
Data may be thus obtained by which the relative age of a
formation or group of strata can be determined, as well as
the mode of deposition, and the agency by which it was
effected; whether in the bed of an ocean, or of a lake, or
estuary,&mdash;by the action of the sea, or of rivers, or running
streams,&mdash;by the effects of icebergs or glaciers,&mdash;by slow
processes through long periods of time, or by sudden
inundations or deluges,&mdash;or by the agency of volcanoes
and earthquakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"> 18 </a></span></p>

<p>The discovery that particular fossils are confined to certain
deposits, was soon productive of important results,
which greatly tended to the advancement of modern Geology;
for although Dr. Lister, more than a century before,
had obtained a glimpse of this law, its principles were
neither understood nor regarded in this country until the
late Dr. William Smith, by his own unaided exertions,
proved by numerous observations on the British strata, its
value and applicability for the identification of a deposit, in
districts remote from each other.</p>

<p>This phenomenon did not escape the notice of the distinguished
French philosophers, MM. Cuvier and Brongniart,
who in their admirable work, "<i>G&eacute;ographie Min&eacute;ralogique
des Environs de Paris</i>," enunciated the same principle:&mdash;</p>

<p class="smaller">"Le moyen que nous avons employ&eacute; pour reconnoitre au milieu
d'un si grand nombre de lits calcaires, un lit d&eacute;j&agrave;, observ&eacute;, dans un
canton tr&egrave;s-&eacute;loign&eacute;, est pris de la nature des fossiles renferm&eacute;s dans
chaque couche; ces fossiles sont toujours g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement les m&ecirc;mes
dans les couches correspondantes, et pr&eacute;sentent d'un syst&egrave;me de
couche &agrave; un autre syst&egrave;me, des diff&eacute;rences d'esp&egrave;ces assez notables.
C'est un signe de reconnoissance qui jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent ne nous a pas

<p>Now, though recent discoveries have shown that this rule
has many exceptions, and that its too stringent adoption
has been productive of some erroneous generalizations, yet
if employed with due caution it is fraught with the most
interesting results, and is the only certain basis of our knowledge
respecting the appearance, continuance, and extinction,
of the lost races of animals and plants, which were once
denizens of our planet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROCKS AND STRATA.</div>

<p>In the "Wonders of Geology" will be found a comprehensive
sketch of the composition and arrangement of the
several formations or groups of strata; and a reference to
that work will afford the student the necessary information
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"> 19 </a></span>
on this branch of Geology. For the convenience of the
general reader I subjoin a synoptical view of the characters
and relations of the British fossiliferous deposits.</p>

<p>The total thickness of the entire series of rocks within
the scope of human examination, is estimated at from fifteen
to twenty miles, reckoning from the summits of the highest
mountains to the greatest depths hitherto penetrated; and
as this vertical section scarcely amounts to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>400</sub>th of the diameter
of the globe, it is familiarly termed the Earth's crust.
The substances of which the sedimentary strata are composed
have been deposited by the action of water, and subsequently
more or less modified in structure and composition
by heat, and by electro-chemical forces. The superficial
accumulations of water-worn detritus, consisting of gravel,
boulders, sand, clay, &amp;c. are termed <i>Drift</i>, or <i>Alluvial</i> deposits.
When the successive layers in which the sediments
subsided are obvious, the deposits are said to be <i>stratified</i>;
when the nature of the materials has been altered by igneous
action or high temperature, but the lines of stratification
are not wholly effaced, the rocks are denominated <i>metamorphic</i>
(<i>transformed</i>). When all traces of organic remains
and of sedimentary deposition are lost, and the mass is
crystalline, and composed of known products of igneous
action, such rocks are named <i>plutonic</i>, as granite, sienite,
trap, basalt, porphyry, and the like. Lastly, rocks resembling
the lavas, scoria, and other substances emitted by
burning mountains still in activity, are called <i>volcanic</i>.</p>

<p>The sedimentary origin ascribed to ancient crystalline
rocks is, of course, hypothetical, since all evidence of aqueous
deposition is wanting, and the minerals (<i>mica</i>, <i>quartz</i>, and
<i>felspar</i>) of which they are so largely constituted, are not
readily soluble in water under ordinary circumstances. But
rocks unquestionably deposited by water, when exposed to
intense heat under great pressure, acquire a crystalline
structure (<i>Wond.</i> p. 864); and a series of changes, from a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"> 20 </a></span>
loose earthy deposit, to compact volcanic lava, may be traced
in numerous instances, so as to leave but little doubt that
the rocks called primitive or primary, <i>may</i> have originally
been either argillaceous, siliceous, or calcareous strata, abounding
in organic remains (<i>Wond.</i> p. 873). These crystalline
masses have been formed at successive periods; for granite
is found of all ages, occurring in the most ancient, as well as
in comparatively modern epochs. The difference between
the composition and aspect of these rocks, and those of
recent volcanoes, is with much probability ascribed to
the fact that the latter are of sub-aerial origin; that is,
were erupted on the surface, and the gaseous products in
consequence escaped; while the former were ejected at great
depths, either beneath the sea, or under immense accumulations
of other deposits, and being thus subjected to great
pressure, the volatile elements were confined, and formed
new combinations: in like manner as chalk when burnt in
the open air is converted into lime, the carbonic acid gas
escaping; but when exposed to the same degree of heat
in a closed iron tube, is transformed into granular marble
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 104).</p>

<p>From these ancient crystalline rocks generally underlying
the sedimentary deposits, and never appearing as if they
had been ejected from a crater, the term <i>hypogene</i><a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (<i>nether-formed</i>)
is employed by Sir C. Lyell to designate the whole
class; and they are subdivided into, 1. <i>plutonic</i>, those in
which all traces of sedimentary origin are lost, as granite;
and 2. <i>metamorphic</i>, those which still manifest traces of stratification,
as mica-schist, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The fossiliferous rocks are, for the convenience of study,
separated into three grand divisions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"> 21 </a></span></p>

<p>1. The <span class="smcap">Tertiary</span>; comprising the deposits between the
Chalk and the superficial Drift and modern Alluvium.</p>

<p>2. The <span class="smcap">Secondary</span>; from the <i>Chalk</i> to the <i>Trias or New
Red</i>, inclusive.</p>

<p>3. The <span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;ozoic</span>; from the <i>Permian</i> to the <i>Silurian</i>;
including the vast series of unfossiliferous slate rocks termed
the <i>Cambrian</i>, in which all traces of organic remains are
lost.</p>

<p>In the following arrangement the strata are enumerated
as if lying in regular sequence, one beneath the other; but
in nature such an unbroken series has never been observed.
A few groups only occur in a serial order, and these but
rarely in their original position. The beds are for the
most part disrupted, and lie in various angles of inclination;
sometimes they are completely retroverted, the
newer strata underlying those upon which they were originally
deposited. The order of succession has been ascertained
by careful observation of the relative superposition of the
respective members of the series in different countries; and
from an immense number of facts collected by able observers
in every part of the globe.</p>

<p>This synopsis presents a chronological arrangement of
the rocks according to the present state of geological knowledge,
but it must not be supposed that these rigid distinctions,
these hard lines, which are necessary to facilitate the
acquisition of a general idea of the phenomena attempted to
be explained, exist in nature. By whatever names we
designate geological periods, there appear to be no clearly
defined boundaries between them in reference to the whole
earth: such well marked lines may be seen in particular
localities, but daily experience teaches us that there is a
blending, and a gradual and insensible passage, from the
lowest to the highest sedimentary strata, particularly in
respect of fossil remains. The terms employed to designate
formations can only be considered as expressing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"> 22 </a></span>
predominance of certain characters, to be used provisionally,
as a convenient mode of classifying and generalizing the
facts collected, whilst that knowledge is accumulating which
in after times will reveal the nature and order of succession
of the principal events in the earth's physical history.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

ganoid fishes (Pterichthys, Coccosteus, Cephalaspis), and will probably

<hr class="tb" />

<p>By a reference to the geological map of England (<i>Wond.</i>
pl. i. vol. i.), it will be seen, that the several formations
appear on the surface in a somewhat chronological order, as
we pass from the eastern or south-eastern part of the Island
to the west or north-west. Thus the principal Tertiary
deposits are situated in the eastern and south-eastern parts;
and proceeding towards the north-west, we traverse successively
the <i>Secondary</i>&mdash;the <i>Chalk</i>, <i>Oolite</i>, <i>Lias</i> and <i>Trias</i>;
then the <i>Pal&aelig;ozoic</i>&mdash;<i>Permian</i>, <i>Carboniferous</i>, and <i>Devonian</i>;
next the <i>Silurian</i> and <i>Cambrian</i>; and at length <i>metamorphic</i>
and <i>primary</i> rocks appear. It is this distribution of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"> 36 </a></span>
strata of the respective formations that has determined the
characters of the physical geography of England. The
Alpine or mountainous districts, which extend north and
south along the western portion of England and Wales,
from Cornwall to Cumberland, are formed by the elevated
masses of the Silurian, Cambrian, and Metamorphic rocks.
These are succeeded by a band of the Carboniferous and
Triassic deposits, with a few intrusions of metamorphic and
plutonic rocks, that stretches from the coast of Devonshire,
through the midland counties, by Leicestershire and Derbyshire,
to Newcastle. On the south-east of this tract, the
Oolite and Cretaceous formations, chiefly made up of
argillaceous and calcareous strata, constitute a diversified
agricultural district, extending from the southern shores of
Hants and Dorset to the coast of Yorkshire. The Wealden
occupies the country lying between the Chalk Downs of
Sussex, Hants, Surrey, and Kent. The Tertiary deposits lie
in basins or depressions of the upper cretaceous rocks in the
south-eastern and eastern maritime districts, and on an extensive
area of these beds stands the metropolis of England;
lastly, irregular accumulations of Drift, containing mammalian
remains in some localities, are spread over the
surface of the ancient formations, and form the immediate
subsoil of the most fertile regions.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ON THE NATURE OF FOSSILS, OR ORGANIC REMAINS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fossils; Petrifactions.</span>&mdash;It is very generally the case,
that persons who are not conversant with the nature of
organic remains, suppose that all fossils are petrifactions;
and unless a specimen has the aspect and hardness of stone,
they regard it as of modern origin, and devoid of interest.
Hence they are surprised to find among the choicest treasures
in the cabinet of the geologist, shells and corals as
perfect in form, as if recently collected from the sea-shore;
bones as little changed, as if they had been interred but for
a short period; and teeth possessing their sharp edges and
enamel unimpaired. In my early researches I fell into this
error, and threw away many beautiful shells that were
associated with casts of ammonites in the marl at Hamsey,
supposing, from their perfect state, that they had been accidentally
imbedded, and were not genuine fossils. But the
state of preservation, and the degree of change which an
organic body has undergone in the mineral kingdom, have
no necessary relation to its antiquity. The shells in some of
the ancient secondary strata are frequently as little changed
as those in modern tertiary deposits. I have collected from
the lowermost clays of the Wealden, fresh-water shells with
traces of the epidermis, and the ligament by which the
valves were held together, perfect; and bones of reptiles
from the strata of Tilgate Forest, as light and porous as
those of the bears and hyenas, from the Caverns of Germany.
On the other hand, fossil remains from the newest tertiary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"> 38 </a></span>
formations are often completely petrified, that is, permeated
by, or transmuted into, stone.</p>

<p>The words <i>fossil</i> and <i>petrifaction</i> are so commonly used as
synonymous terms, even by educated persons, that it is
necessary to define the sense in which they are employed in
these volumes.</p>

<p><i>Fossils</i> are the durable parts of animal and vegetable
structures imbedded in rocks and strata by natural causes
at a remote period; thus wood in a state of lignite, bog-wood,
and coal, or of siliceous or calcareous stone, is <i>fossil
wood</i>; and bones or shells, whether in an earthy and decaying
state, or permeated by calc-spar, flint, or iron, and converted
into a hard mineral substance, are alike <i>fossil bones</i>
or <i>shells</i>.</p>

<p><i>Petrifactions</i> are the remains of animals and vegetables in
which the original structure is converted into stone, or, in
other words, is <i>petrified</i>; such are the silicified stems of
trees from Antigua, and Germany, and the calcified bones
and shells in the Oolitic and Wealden limestones. Such petrifactions
may be correctly termed fossil plants, bones, or
shells; but similar organic remains, though of equal antiquity,
which have not undergone such changes, are not
petrifactions in the proper meaning of that term.</p>

<p>The process by which petrifaction is effected is still involved
in obscurity; mineral solutions have permeated the
original tissues, and the organic molecules have been replaced
by mineral molecules, but how this transmutation is produced
is not understood. Mr. Dana's observations and Mr.
Jeffery's experiments have, however, thrown much light on
the process of silicification.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> See <i>Wond.</i> p. 100.</p></div>

<p><i>Incrustations.</i>&mdash;Another prevalent error is that of considering
Incrustations to be fossils or petrifactions; a mistake
which is sanctioned by the custom of calling waters that are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"> 39 </a></span>
charged with calcareous earth (<i>lime</i>), and deposit it in considerable
quantity, petrifying springs; as those of Matlock,
and other places in Derbyshire. (<i>Wond.</i> p. 76.) But incrustations
are not petrifactions; stems and branches of
trees, skulls, bones, shells, &amp;c., are simply invested with a
calcareous coating or crust, which is generally porous and
friable, but often crystalline and compact. The inclosed
bodies are not permeated by the stony matter; if the mass
be broken, or the incrustation removed, we find the twig, or
stem, either dry and shrivelled, as in the specimens, <a href="#Plate_III">figs. 2,
3, 4, Plate III.</a>; or tubular cavities are left by the decay and
removal of the vegetable structure, as in <a href="#Plate_III">fig. 10, Plate III.</a></p>

<p>But although incrustations be not petrifactions, natural
specimens, (not the so-called petrified nests and twigs, in
which the bad taste of the guardians of the Derbyshire
springs is embodied, and dispersed all over England,) are
objects of considerable interest, as illustrative of a process,
by which important changes are effected in the mineral
kingdom. Thus springs as clear and sparkling as poet
ever feigned or sung, may transform beds of loose sand and
gravel into rock, and porous stone into solid marble, and
cover extensive tracts of country with layers of concretionary
and crystalline limestone. This process is effected in the
following manner. Most fresh water holds in solution a
certain proportion of carbonate of lime; and changes of
temperature, as well as other causes, will occasion this calcareous
earth to be in part or wholly precipitated. The
<i>fur</i>, as it is called, that lines a kettle or boiler which has
been long in use, affords a familiar illustration of this fact.
At the temperature of 60&deg; lime is soluble in 700 times its
weight of water; and if to the solution a small portion of
carbonic acid be added, a carbonate of lime is formed, which
is thrown down in an insoluble state. But if the carbonic
acid be in such quantity as to supersaturate the lime, it is
again rendered soluble in water: it is thus that carbonate of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"> 40 </a></span>
lime, held in solution by an excess of carbonic acid, not in
actual combination with the lime, but contained in the water,
and acting as a menstruum, is commonly found in all waters.
An absorption of carbonic acid, or a loss of that portion
which exists in excess, will therefore occasion the lime to be
set free, and precipitated on the foreign bodies in the water,
as stones, twigs, leaves, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The substance thus deposited is termed <i>tufa</i>, or travertine;<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
and in some parts of Italy, and of our own Island,
it constitutes beds of stone of great extent, in which bones,
shells, and the impressions of leaves and stems, are preserved.
The stalactites and stalagmites of caverns have a similar
origin; many of these caves are of incalculable antiquity,
and beneath their stalagmitic floors, the bones and teeth of
extinct carnivorous animals are found in vast quantities.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> <i>Travertine</i>, so called from the river <i>Tibur</i>, whose waters are loaded
with calcareous earth&mdash;<i>Tiburtina</i>, Ital. <i>travertina</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Silicification</span>, or petrifaction by Silex or Flint.&mdash;Silex,
or the earth of flint, is held in solution in large proportions,
in certain thermal or boiling springs, which, on cooling,
deposit the siliceous matter (in the same manner as the
travertine is precipitated from incrusting streams) on foreign
substances, and produce exquisite chalcedonic infiltrations
of mosses, &amp;c. But this operation is now only known to be
in activity in the immediate neighbourhood of foci of volcanic
action, as in the celebrated Geysers of Iceland (<i>Wond.</i>
p. 95), and the boiling springs of the volcano of Tongariro,
in New Zealand (98). We have everywhere evidence that
in former periods, the petrifaction, as well as the incrustation
of organic bodies by silex, was carried on to an
immense extent; and, doubtless, far beneath the surface,
the same operation is at the present moment in constant
progress, and effecting as important changes in the consolidation
of loose materials, as in the earlier geological epochs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"> 41 </a></span></p>

<p>The various states in which silex occurs have depended
on its fluidity; in quartz crystals the solution appears to
have been complete; in agate and chalcedony it was in a
gelatinous state, assuming a spheroidal or orbicular disposition,
according to the motion given to its particles. Its
condition appears also to have been modified by the influence
of organic matter. In some polished slices of siliceous
nodules the transition from flint to agate, chalcedony, and
crystallized quartz, is beautifully shown. The curious fact,
that the cavities of echinites in chalk are almost invariably
filled with flint, while their crustaceous cases are changed
into calc-spar, is probably, in many instances, to be attributed
to the animal matter having undergone silicification;
for the soft gelatinous parts are those which appear to have
been most susceptible of this transmutation. In some
specimens, the oyster is changed into flint, while the shell is
converted into crystallized carbonate of lime. In a Trigonia
from Tisbury, formerly in the cabinet of the late
Miss Benett, of Norton House, near Warminster, the body
of the mollusk was completely metamorphosed into a pure
chalcedony, the branchi&aelig; or gills being as clearly defined
as when the animal was recent. In specimens of wood
from Australia (presented to the British Museum by Sir
Thomas Mitchell), which are thoroughly permeated by
silex, there are on the external surface some spots of chalcedony
that have apparently originated from the exudation
of the liquid silex from the interior in viscid globules filled
with air, which burst, and then collapsed, and became
solidified in their present form.</p>

<p>In silicified wood the permeation of the vegetable tissues
by the mineral matter, appears to have been effected by
solutions of silex of a high temperature. In some examples
the mineralization is simply a replacement: the original
substance has been removed atom by atom, and the silex
substituted in its place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"> 42 </a></span></p>

<p>One of the most eminent naturalists and chemists of
the United States, Mr. Dana,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> suggests that the reason
why silica is so common a material in the constitution of
fossil wood and shells, as well as in pseudo-morphic crystals,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
is the ready solution of silex in water at a high
temperature (a fact affirmed by Bergman<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>) under great
pressure, whenever an alkali is present, as is seen at the
present time in many volcanic regions, and its deposition
again when the water cools. A mere heated aqueous
solution of silica, under high pressure, is sufficient to explain
the phenomenon of the silicification of organic structures.
Mr. Dana states that a crystal of calc-spar in such a fluid
being exposed to solution, from the action of the heated
water alone, the silica deposits itself gradually on a reduction
of temperature, and takes the place of the lime, atom
by atom, as soon as set free. Every silicified fossil is an
example of this pseudo-morphism; but there seems to be
no union of the silica with the lime, for silicate of lime is
of rare occurrence.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>I proceed to consider the various states in which the
remains of animals and plants are preserved in the mineral
kingdom, and shall occasionally offer suggestions for collecting
and preparing specimens; but particular instructions
on this head will be given in the sequel, when the different
kinds of fossils are respectively considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL ANIMAL REMAINS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Animal Remains.</span>&mdash;Of the higher orders of animals, the
more durable portions of the skeleton, as the bones and teeth,
are almost the only parts that occur in a fossil state; except
in some remarkable instances, in which entire carcasses of
extinct species of Elephant, and of Rhinoceros, have been
found imbedded in solid ice, and frozen gravel. (<i>Wond.</i>
p. 152.) The countries of arctic regions are now the only
localities in which such phenomena are likely to be met
with; it appears, however, that in some remote period, the
bodies of large mammalia were transported by icebergs into
temperate regions, where the ice melted, and the animals
either sunk to the bottom of the sea, or were drifted into
estuaries, or stranded on the shore: the soft parts then
decomposed, and the skeletons and detached bones were
left imbedded in the silt, sand, or shingle.</p>

<p>In this manner alone can be explained the occurrence of
bones and teeth of the mammoth, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
&amp;c. so common in the alluvial or drifted deposits of this
country; for these relics, though extremely friable, and
buried in shingle, boulders, and other transported materials,
are not water-worn, but in numerous instances remain as
sharp and perfect as when recent. In the ancient shingle
of Brighton cliffs (<i>Wond.</i> p. 114), I have found bones and
teeth of horse, deer, ox, whale, &amp;c. impacted with quartz
and granite pebbles and boulders; the bones, though crumbling
to pieces if not very carefully removed, being entire,
and the whole mass held together by calcareous spar,
deposited by water that had, during the lapse of ages, percolated
through the chalk-rubble above.</p>

<p>Fossil bones are found in four different states: 1. With
their animal matter, as in the bones of the Mastodons
from Big-bone Lick, Kentucky. 2. With the animal matter
removed. 3. With the earthy matter partly removed,
4. With the animal matter carbonized, or converted into
bitumen; this change is common in the blue Lias clay;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"> 44 </a></span>
the bones retain their usual quantity of phosphate of lime,
but the animal matter is converted into carbon. This
alteration appears to have taken place unconnected with a
high temperature, and to have been a spontaneous change
in a moist situation, to which air had no access.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Mr. Smee, London Med. Gazette, November 1840.</p></div>

<p>Another, and very remarkable condition, is that in which
the phosphate of lime has been removed by the infiltration
of water charged with sulphuric or carbonic acid, and the
gelatin converted into leather by tannin; as is the case
with bones and teeth of deer, horses, &amp;c. obtained from a
submerged forest of oak, larch, &amp;c. near Ferry-bridge, in
Yorkshire; of which there are many instructive specimens
in the York Museum.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>The cancellated structure (that is, the little cells or pores)
of the long-bones of mammalia, found in caverns in England
and Germany, and in the breccia of Gibraltar, and the
conglomerates of Ava and the Sub-Himalaya mountains,
&amp;c., are often filled with crystallized carbonate of lime. In
the Wealden deposits the osseous carapaces and plastrons of
Turtles, and the bones and teeth of Crocodiles, Lizards, &amp;c.,
are almost without exception heavy, and of various shades
of brown or umber, from the infiltration of solutions of
carbonates and oxides of iron.</p>

<p>In some instances, bones of a jet black are imbedded
in the white calciferous grit; the phosphoric acid in the
original organism having combined with iron and produced
a deep blue or black phosphate of that mineral, and left
the surrounding stone uncoloured.</p>

<p>Petrifaction by the infiltration of calcareous solutions is
equally common; and the medullary cavities of the bones are
frequently lined or filled with white calc-spar; brilliant pyrites
also enters into the composition of these fossils, frosting over
with a golden metallic deposit the cavities and fissures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"> 45 </a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL BONES.</div>

<p>The permeation of the teeth by mineral matter, produces
beautiful examples of the tissues of those organs; the
dentine is often stained throughout with a rich sienna tint,
and sections viewed under the microscope by transmitted
light, reveal the character and distribution of the calcigerous
tubes more clearly even than in recent specimens.</p>

<p>It is extremely rare that osseous structures are found
petrified by flint; among the many thousands of bones
which I have extracted from the rocks, or have seen in collections,
I know but of one instance of a silicified vertebra,
that of a Mosasaurus, from a chalk-pit near Brighton; and
a few bones and scales of fishes. But notwithstanding the
weight and apparent solidity imparted by these modes of
mineralization, the substance is generally rendered extremely
brittle, so that the development of the bones from the stone
in which they are imbedded, and the removal of the hard
ferrugino-calcareous crust investing them, is no easy task,
but requires much tact, experience, and patience, to execute
successfully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hints for collecting fossil bones.</span>&mdash;The light, friable,
porous bones, require great care in their removal from the
deposit in which they are imbedded, whether it be clay,
consolidated shingle, or limestone; if of considerable size,
they will almost invariably break to pieces, and many
examples will not admit of repair. It is therefore always
desirable, before attempting to extract a large bone, to
make a sketch of it; its form will thus be known, should it
be destroyed; and if it crack into fragments that will admit
of reunion, the drawing will be a valuable guide for the
replacement of the separated parts. If only a few pieces
remain, those which show any portion of the terminations,
or joints, should be preserved, as they afford the most
precise and important characters. The faithful record even
of an imperfect and unknown fossil is not without value;
and as the antiquary carefully preserves shreds of ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"> 46 </a></span>
manuscripts, in the hope that other documents may one
day come to light, and enable him to interpret these now
unintelligible records; so the geologist should treasure up
every fragment of an undetermined organic remain, for
the time may arrive, as I have often experienced, when
specimens will be discovered that may illustrate its nature,
and prove it to be of considerable interest.</p>

<p>The broken porous bones may be easily repaired by a
hot weak solution of glue; and when the joinings are set,
the bone should be saturated with thin glue, well brushed
in, and the surface be sponged clean with very hot water
before the cement is congealed. When dry, the specimens will
be found to possess considerable firmness and durability.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
By this process the tusks of mammoths and elephants may
be restored, however much crushed; time, patience, and a
little dexterity, only are required, to convert a heap of mere
fragments into a valuable relic of the ancient world.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> A liquid, called "Neuber's liquid glue," is an excellent cement
for this purpose: it is sold at No. 54, New Oxford Street, London.</p></div>

<p>When the bones are tolerably perfect, but dry and friable
from the loss of their animal oil, they may be made
durable by saturating them with drying oil, and exposing
them to a considerable degree of heat; in this manner the
magnificent skeletons of the sloth tribe, the Megatherium,
and Mylodon, in the Hunterian Museum, were prepared.
When a bone appears as if cracked into numerous pieces
before its removal, but still preserves its form, the only
method by which it can be successfully extracted, is by
spreading over it a thick layer of plaster of Paris, which
should be used of the consistence of cream; when it sets,
(which, if the plaster be recently prepared, will be in the
course of a few minutes,) the specimen may be carefully
extricated, and the plaster removed or not, according to
the nature of the fossil, and the parts to be displayed.
The bones of the large reptiles which occur in the Wealden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"> 47 </a></span>
and Oolite, may be restored in the same manner. These
remains are generally very brittle, and when imbedded
in hard grit cannot be extracted whole: they will often
fall to pieces on the slightest blow of the hammer or
chisel. When of moderate size, it is best not to attempt
their removal from the stone, but to trim the block into a
convenient shape, and carefully chisel away the surrounding
part, so as to expose the essential characters of the
bone. In all cases this is an excellent method where practicable,
for such specimens have a double interest; they are
at once illustrative examples of the fossil, and of the rock
in which it was deposited.</p>

<p>But many specimens will not admit of this method; and
with large ones it is inconvenient and undesirable, except
where bones lie in juxtaposition. The large examples in
Tilgate grit, (figured in the Fossils of Tilgate Forest,) were
all extracted piecemeal from the rock: and most of the
gigantic bones of the Iguanodon, &amp;c. now in the British
Museum, were originally in many hundred pieces, and were
cemented together with glue in the manner above described;
I have found no other method so convenient and effective.</p>

<p>When a bone is too imperfect to be united as a whole, it
may be imbedded in Roman cement, or plaster of Paris,
which when dry may be coloured of the prevailing tint of
the rock. For large heavy specimens, the cement is preferable;
it is of easy application, and the fissures and cracks
of the bones may be filled up with it, taking care first to
cover the parts with thin hot glue, or the cement, when it
dries, will shrink and fall out. A thin coating of mastic
varnish will restore the colour, and by excluding the air,
tend to preserve the specimens.</p>

<p>The teeth have generally undergone the same changes as
the bones with which they are associated. The teeth of
elephants or mammoths that are imbedded in loose calcareous
earth, like the loam and chalk-rubble of Brighton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"> 48 </a></span>
cliffs, and of Walton in Essex, are friable, and apt to split
and separate in the direction of the vertical plates of dentine
and bone: the pieces should be glued together, and
when set, the tooth be thoroughly saturated with thin glue,
used very hot, and the superfluous cement removed with a
sponge wrung out as dry as possible from boiling water.
If there be any portion of the jaw attached to the teeth, it
must be carefully preserved; and search should be made
for fragments of the articulations, or parts of the joints and
sockets.</p>

<p>In argillaceous strata, as the Lias-shale, London Clay, &amp;c.,
the fossils are frequently saturated with brilliant pyrites, or
sulphuret of iron; a mineral which decomposes upon exposure
to the atmosphere, and occasions the destruction of the
specimens. The fossils of the Isle of Sheppey are peculiarly
obnoxious to this change.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL ANIMAL REMAINS.</div>

<p>The remains of vertebrated animals in the Lias, very
often occur as skeletons more or less perfect, the entire configuration
of the original being preserved in many instances
(<i>Bd.</i> pl. 7. <i>Petrifactions</i>, p. 340). But the deposit in which
they lie is generally laminated, and the shale flakes off without
great care; much time, labour, and practice are therefore
required, to obtain specimens of any considerable size. To
the late Miss Mary Anning, of Lyme Regis, the merit is due,
of having first accomplished this difficult task; Mr. Hawkins
has subsequently carried the art to perfection, as may be
seen in the marvellous examples of Ichthyosauri and Plesiosauri,
in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Petrifactions, Room IV. chap. iv. pp. 341, 376.</p></div>

<p>The small specimens, such as the detached paddles, groups
of vertebr&aelig; and ribs, &amp;c., that are likely to come under the
collector's notice in his personal researches, are not difficult
of preservation. Mr. Hawkins employed a strong watery
solution of gum arabic as the cement, and plaster of Paris
as the ground, using shallow wooden trays of well-seasoned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"> 49 </a></span>
wood, in which the specimens were permanently imbedded:
the bones, scales, &amp;c. were then varnished with a solution of
mastic, and the ground coloured bluish grey, to imitate
the Lias. I have had considerable practice in the dissection
of skeletons imbedded in Lias, and having found the method
previously described answer every purpose, have not employed
that recommended by Mr. Hawkins.</p>

<p>The scales of reptiles and fishes, either in connected
masses or detached, are frequently met with in great perfection,
and sometimes associated with the teeth and bones.
In the Lias, even the remains of the skin and integuments
(<i>Bd.</i> pl. 10) have been discovered. Whenever any part of
a skeleton is found lying in shale or stone, the surrounding
block should therefore be carefully examined, to ascertain if
there be traces of the skin or integuments, before any
part is removed by the chisel. The specimen of an Ichthyosaurian
paddle, figured in the second volume of this work,
affords a good illustration of the propriety of this caution.
Around the bones are seen the carbonized remains of the
cartilaginous fringe that supported the integuments, and
thus the perfect form of the paddle has been ascertained;
had the surrounding stone been chiselled away, the most
important characters would have been obliterated, as probably
they have been in numerous instances.</p>

<p>Nodular masses of indurated clay containing fishes, are
often broken with difficulty in such a manner as will expose
the enclosed fossil, for the nodule generally splits in various
directions, and the specimen is irreparably mutilated or
defaced. My friend Sir Woodbine Parish informs me that
by subjecting such nodules to a high temperature&mdash;but not
to a red heat&mdash;and then plunging them in cold water, they
may when dry, by a properly directed blow of a hammer,
be readily fractured in a direction parallel with the plane
of the imbedded fossil, and the fish be laid bare in the most
favourable position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"> 50 </a></span></p>

<p>The scales of fishes, and the integuments of marine reptiles,
are not the only vestiges of the dermal coverings of
vertebrated animals that are preserved by mineralization.
Traces of the wing-integument of flying reptiles, and of the
feathers of birds, are sometimes manifest: and even when
every atom of the original structure has perished, the impression
may remain, and afford satisfactory results. The
footmarks of unknown animals are often preserved in the
rocks, and the imprints of the feet of several species of
bipeds, presumed to be birds of colossal size, in tracks as
distinct as if but recently made, have been discovered in
the New Red sandstone of North America; in the section
on fossil birds, this highly interesting subject will be fully
explained.</p>

<p>The student, even from this brief review, will perceive
how many valuable facts may be unnoticed, and irretrievably
lost, unless attention be paid to the various circumstances
under which fossil remains are presented to his
notice.</p>

<p>Of the invertebrated orders, the most durable, and consequently
the most numerous relics, are shells and corals.
The integuments of the eyes, antenn&aelig;, and wings of Insects
occur; and the shelly coverings of Crustaceans are not
uncommon; those of the Echinoderms, the Star-fishes, and
of the Crinoidea or Lily-animals, are very abundant in certain
deposits. Instructions for the collection and arrangement
of these fossils will be given in the chapters in which
they are severally described.</p>

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL BOTANY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Vegetables.</span>&mdash;The remains of the vegetable kingdom
are presented to the notice of the geologist in various
conditions; in some instances these relics are but little
changed in their aspect, as, for example, in the recent accumulations
of mud and silt, at the bottoms of lakes and
rivers, and in morasses, and peat-bogs. In tufaceous incrustations,
the imprints of wood, and of leaves and stems, are
often sharply defined on the solid masses of concretionary
and crystalline limestone.</p>

<p>In the ancient deposits, vegetables are found in two different
states. In the one their substance is completely
permeated by mineral matter; it may be calcareous (<i>lime</i>),
siliceous (<i>flint</i>), ferruginous (<i>iron</i>), or pyritous (<i>sulphuret of
iron</i>); and yet both the external characters, and the internal
structure, may be preserved. Such are the fossil
trees of the Isle of Portland, fragments of which so closely
resemble decayed wood, as to deceive the casual observer,
until by close examination of their texture and substance he
finds that they possess the weight and hardness of stone.
In the silicified wood which abounds in many of the tertiary
strata, the most delicate tissues of the original are preserved,
and by microscopical examination (see <a href="#Plate_V">Pl. V.</a>) may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"> 52 </a></span>
be displayed in a distinct and beautiful manner. In calcareous
fossil wood the structure is also retained; and in many
limestones, leaves and seed-vessels are well preserved.</p>

<p>The ligneous coverings, or the husks and shells, of nuciferous
fruits, and the cones or strobili of Firs and Pines, are
frequently met with in an excellent state of preservation;
in some rare instances indications of flowers have been
observed (<a href="#lign_67"><i>Lign.</i> 67</a>). The parts of fructification in some
of the fern tribe (<i>Lign.</i> <a href="#lign_25">25</a> and <a href="#lign_27">27</a>), occur in coal-shale, and
in the grit of Tilgate Forest (<i>Wond.</i> p. 394): the pollen,
and the resinous secretions of pines and firs, have been discovered
in tertiary marls, and in the Greensand. The well-known
substance. Amber, so much in request for ornaments,
is unquestionably of vegetable origin; it has been found
impacted in the trunks of its parent trees (<i>Wond.</i> p. 242).
The <i>fossil resin</i> discovered in the London clay, at Highgate
and the Isle of Sheppey, is doubtless referable to the conifer&aelig;
found in that deposit.</p>

<p>In the Clathrari&aelig; of Tilgate Forest, indications of a resinous
secretion have been detected.</p>

<p>The <i>Diamond</i>, which is pure charcoal, is probably a vegetable
secretion, that has acquired a crystalline structure by
electro-chemical forces. It has been converted into <i>Coke</i>
and <i>Graphite</i> by the action of intense heat; and the electrical
properties of the substance were changed, the Diamond
being an insulator, and the Coke, a conductor of electricity.
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 706.)</p>

<p>When the microscope is more extensively employed in
investigations of this kind, it is probable that the siliceous
spines and stars which begem the foliage of many plants
(as the <i>Deutzia</i>, <i>Lithospermum officinale</i>, &amp;c), will be discovered
in a fossil state, for they are as indestructible as
the frustules of Diatomace&aelig;, and the spicules of sponges
which are so common in flint and chalcedony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL VEGETABLES.</div>

<p>But vegetables occur not only as petrified stems, leaves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"> 53 </a></span>
and fruits, associated with other remains in the strata, but
also in beds of great thickness and extent, consisting wholly
of plants transmuted, by that peculiar process which vegetable
matter undergoes when excluded from atmospheric
influence, and under great pressure, into <i>Lignite</i>, and <i>Coal</i>.
And there are intermediate stages of this process, in which
the form and structure of the trees and plants are apparent;
and a gradual transition may be traced, from the peat-wood
and submerged forests of modern epochs, in which leaves,
fruits, and trunks of indigenous species are preserved, to
those ancient accumulations of carbonaceous matter, whose
vegetable origin the eye of science can alone detect.</p>

<p>For the collection and preservation of fossil vegetables,
with the exception of those which are permeated with.
pyrites (as those of the Isle of Sheppey, &amp;c.), but few
instructions are required. The silicified and calcareous
stems are generally easy of extraction, even when imbedded
in hard stone, and if broken can be repaired with glue.
When the stems bear the imprints of leaf-stalks (as in
<i>Lign.</i> <a href="#lign_31">31</a> and <a href="#lign_54">54</a>), the surrounding stone should be carefully
examined, with the view of detecting impressions, or other
indications of the foliage. Delicate leaves in clay, or shale,
must not be washed; a thin coat of mastic varnish, or of
gum-water, applied with a camel-hair pencil, will preserve
them, and render them more distinct. When a leaf, fruit,
seed-vessel, or other fragile object is attached to clay or
friable sandstone, it is advisable to glue the specimen to a
piece of thin wood or pasteboard, of suitable proportions.</p>

<p>The Sheppey fruits and other fossils permeated with iron
pyrites, generally decompose after a few months' exposure to
the air. The fruits, especially, are liable to decomposition;
Mr. Bowerbank keeps his specimens in bottles of water; a
solution of isinglass in spirits of wine is the best varnish
to preserve such fossils, without obscuring their character
and injuring their appearance: but even this method is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"> 54 </a></span>
often unavailing. The pyritified fir-cones of the Wealden
decompose in like manner: I have had the misfortune to
lose several unique and most instructive specimens from
this cause; boiling them in linseed oil preserves them, but
greatly impairs their appearance.</p>

<p class="caption3">ON THE INVESTIGATION OF THE FOSSIL REMAINS OF
VEGETABLES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vegetable Organization.</span>&mdash;As fragments of the stems,
trunks, and branches, are very often the only vestiges of
fossil plants, a knowledge of the characters by which the
principal divisions of the vegetable kingdom may be distinguished
by their internal structure, is indispensable to the
successful investigation of the Flora of the ancient world.
Although I have treated of this subject in the Wonders of
Geology, (<i>Wond.</i> p. 694,) it will here be necessary to present
the student with more ample details. The excellent
introductory botanical works of Dr. Lindley, and Professor
Henslow, convey full information on this, and every
other department of the science, and should be consulted
by those who intend to make this branch of Geology their
particular study. For the general reader, and amateur
collector, the following brief notice of a few obvious essential
characters of vegetable organization, may perhaps afford
sufficient information, to enable them to understand the
principles on which the successful investigation of the nature
and affinities of fossil plants must be conducted.</p>

the most simple forms of vegetation consist of a congeries
of cells (<i>cellular tissue</i>) of the same kind, and have no
visible fructification; such are the sea-weeds (<i>alg&aelig;</i>, <i>confer&aelig;</i>, &amp;c.),
mosses, and lichens. In the more complex
tribes the cells become variously modified, are elongated into
tubes or vessels (<i>vascular tissue</i>), some of which possess a
spiral structure, and others have their sides studded with
little glands. The vascular tissue consists of two kinds of
vessels. 1. The <i>spiral vessels</i> or <i>trache&aelig;</i>: these are membraneous
tubes, with conical extremities, having within a
coil of elastic fibre spirally twisted, and capable of being
unrolled (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign.</i> 1, <i>b.</i></a>). 2. The <i>ducts</i>; which are a modification
of the structure of the spiral vessel; their extremities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"> 56 </a></span>
are rounded or conical, and their sides marked with transverse
lines, rings, or bars. Their functions appear to be
different from those of the spiral vessels, and they are found
in situations where the latter never occur.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> "A <i>cell</i> in botanical language, means a little bag composed of
membrane, and containing a living substance capable of spontaneous
growth by multiplication, or division of its parts. Of such little
bodies, millions of which may be contained within the space of a
cubic inch, all the soft parts of vegetables are composed; in sea-weeds
they are often of large size."&mdash;Dr. Harvey's Sea-side Book, with which
the reader is doubtless familiar.</p></div>

<p>The organization of the stem in the whole class of flowering
plants, possesses characters so evident, as to afford the
most important aid in the investigation of their fossil
remains. Without dwelling on minor modifications, they
are separable into two divisions, namely, the Endogenous
(signifying <i>to grow from within</i>), and the Exogenous (<i>to
grow from without</i>). Both possess vascular tissue, but so
differently arranged in the two classes, as to constitute distinctive
characters which are seldom obliterated, although
what was once a flexible stem, is now a mass of flint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Endogenous Stems.</span>&mdash;As the seeds of the plants belonging
to this division have but one cotyledon, or <i>seed-lobe</i>, as the
Lily, they are also termed monocotyledonous; the reader
therefore must remember that these terms are synonymous.
These stems consist of an uniform mass of cellular tissue,
in which bundles of vascular or woody fibre are imbedded;
a transverse section presents a surface dotted over with spots,
produced by the division of these groups of vessels, pretty
uniformly distributed, but more densely arranged towards
the circumference (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1, fig. 4</i></a>). A slice of cane affords
an illustration of this structure.</p>

<p>The increase of these stems is effected by the formation
of new cells and bundles of vessels in the central axis, which
force their way among the old tissue, and occasion the condensation
of the latter towards the outer edge. These plants
have neither pith, concentric circles of woody fibre, nor true
bark; negative characters of the highest importance in the
determination of fossil stems.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Exogenous Stems.</span>&mdash;The seeds have two cotyledons, or
seed-lobes, as in the Bean, hence the plants of this class are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"> 57 </a></span>
also called dicotyledonous. In these stems the cellular tissue
forms a central column, or pith (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1, fig. 2, a</i>.</a>), and an
external band, or cylinder, called the bark (<a href="#lign_1"><i>fig. 2, b</i>.</a>); the
two being connected by thin vertical plates, termed medullary
rays, which are also formed of cells (<a href="#lign_1"><i>fig. 2, c, c</i>.</a>); the
diagram, <a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1</i></a>, exhibits this arrangement. The interval
between the pith and the bark, and the interspaces of the
vertical radiating plates (<a href="#lign_1"><i>fig. 2, d</i>.</a>), are filled up by woody
fibre or vascular tissue, consisting of spiral and other vessels.
The ligneous structure of exogenous stems consists, therefore,
of a cylinder formed of wedge-shaped processes, that
extend between the medullary rays to the pith, and is
surrounded by the bark; a new zone of woody fibre is added
annually between the bark and the former cylinder, and
from this mode of increase the term <i>exogenous</i> is derived:
a transverse section of a branch of oak or ash will show
this structure. The rings, or concentric circles, are the
annual zones of wood; the fine lines radiating from the
centre, or pith, to the circumference, or bark, are the medullary
rays (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1, fig. 2, c</i></a>: see also <a href="#Plate_V"><i>Plate V. fig. 4</i></a>).</p>

<p>The organization above described, will be found more or
less manifest in fossil wood, stems, and branches. The
monocotyledonous structure is beautifully displayed in the
silicified stems of palms from Antigua (<a href="#Plate_V"><i>Plate V. fig. 1, 1<sup>a</sup>.</i></a>):
and the dicotyledonous, in petrified trees from Egypt. The
pith, medullary rays, vascular tissue, and circles of growth,
are preserved in the siliceous and calcareous wood found in
many parts of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRUCTURE OF CONIFER&AElig;.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Structure of Conifer&aelig;</span> (<i>cone-bearing</i>).&mdash;The remains of
a numerous family of dicotyledonous trees, termed <i>Conifer&aelig;</i>,
as the pine, fir, larch, &amp;c., are so abundant in the stratified
rocks, that it is necessary to describe in more detail the
peculiarity of structure by which their stems and branches
may be recognised. The most delicate woody tissue, as we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"> 58 </a></span>
have above stated, consists of elongated cells or tubes, of
two kinds: in the one, the membrane of which they are composed
is smooth: in the other, the walls of the tubes are
covered by little oval or circular bodies called glands (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign.
1, fig. 1, c.</i></a>). A branch of larch or pine, split longitudinally,
and viewed by a powerful lens, will exhibit the appearance
here described. This glandular structure is so constantly
and largely developed in the conifer&aelig;, that although it is
also possessed by other aromatic trees, we shall rarely err in
referring fossil wood in which this organization is apparent,
to this family of vegetables (see <a href="#Plate_V"><i>Plate V. figs. 2, 3</i></a>). These
glands in the pines and firs, are supposed to be the cells
which secrete a colourless volatile oil, that exudes in the
state of turpentine.</p>

<p>From this general account of the vegetable structures
that may be expected to occur in the mineral kingdom, the
student will in some measure be prepared for the investigation
of fossil trees and plants; but for the guidance of
those who are wholly unacquainted with the principles on
which the Natural System of Botany adopted in this work,
is founded, I am induced to present the following concise
view of the principal divisions of the vegetable kingdom,
though it involves some repetition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOTANICAL PRINCIPLES.</div>

<p>The following summary is given nearly in Dr. Lindley's
own language:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Botanical Principles.</span>&mdash;One of the first things that
strikes an inquirer into the structure of plants, is the fact,
that while all species are capable of propagating their race,
the mode in which this function is effected is essentially
different in different cases. In most tribes of plants, flowers
are produced, and these are succeeded by fruit, containing
seed, which is shed, or scattered abroad, and grows into new
individuals. But in certain families (the <i>Cryptogamia</i>), as
Ferns, Mosses, Mushrooms, and the like, neither flowers, nor
seeds properly so called, have been detected; but propagation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"> 59 </a></span>
is effected by the dispersion of grains or spores, which
are usually generated in the substance of the plant, and
seem to have but little analogy with true seeds. Hence the
vegetable kingdom is separated into two distinct groups,
namely, the <i>flowering</i> (<i>Phanerogamia</i>), and the <i>flowerless</i>
(<i>Cryptogamia</i> or <i>Agamia</i>). As the former usually possess
a highly developed system of spiral and other vessels, while
the latter are either altogether destitute of them, or have
them only in a few of the highest orders, and those in a
peculiar state, the flowering plants are termed Vasculares,
and the flowerless <i>Cellulares</i>. And as all the flowering, or
vascular plants, when they form stems, increase by an extension
of their ends, and a distension or enlargement of
their circumference, but the flowerless or cellular plants
form their stems simply by the addition of new matter to
their points, the latter are called <i>Acrogens</i>, signifying increase
from the summit.</p>

<p>Flowering plants are also for the most part furnished
with respiratory or breathing organs (<i>stomata</i>), of which the
flowerless vegetables are to a great extent destitute.</p>

<p>The flowering or vascular plants are also divisible into
two well marked groups, namely, the <i>Exogens</i>, or <i>Dicotyledons</i>,
and the <i>Endogens</i>, or <i>Monocotyledons</i>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Exogens</span> (growing from without), increase by the
addition of new woody matter to the outside of the stems
beneath the bark; and they are further characterized by
the embryo having two or more cotyledons, or seed-lobes,
hence they are also called <i>Dicotyledons</i>; such as the Elm,
Beech, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Endogens</span>, as we have previously stated, increase by
the addition of ligneous matter to the inside of their stems
near the centre; and as the embryo in this class has but one
cotyledon, they are likewise termed <i>monocotyledons</i>, as the
Cane, Palm, &amp;c. Again, exogenous plants have the young
external wood connected with a central pith, by medullary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"> 60 </a></span>
processes; while endogens do not possess such a structure,
having no central pith. In exogens the veins (venation)
of the leaves, are disposed in meshes, like net-work, but in
endogens the veins run parallel to each other.</p>

<p>The number of parts in the flower of an exogenous plant
is usually five, or its multiples: in the endogens it is commonly
three, or its multiples. In the germination, the
young root of exogens is a mere extension of the radicle; but
in endogens it is protruded from within.</p>

<p>Thus, in the flowering or vascular plants, we have two
groups distinct from each other in their germination, the
structure of their stems and leaves, their mode of growth,
the arrangement of the parts of the flower, and in the
structure of the embryo.</p>

<p>The vegetable kingdom is thus separated into three
natural classes,&mdash;1, the <i>Exogens</i>, 2, the <i>Endogens</i>, 3, the
<i>Acrogens</i>; but there are likewise other divisions, a knowledge
of which is of great importance in the study of
fossil botany; the sub-class termed <span class="smcap">Gymnosperms</span> especially
requires notice.</p>

<p>In the strictly exogenous and endogenous plants, the
fertilizing principle is communicated to the young seeds
through the medium of a <i>stigma</i> and <i>style</i>, that terminate
the case or pericarp in which the seeds are enclosed: but
in another important group of the vegetable kingdom, the
pollen is directly applied to the ovule, without the intervention
of any pericarpial apparatus; hence these are termed
<i>Gymnosperms</i>, signifying naked seeds. These plants have
the same relation to the other exogens, as frogs and analogous
reptiles bear to the other orders of their Class; they comprise
the two natural orders <i>Conifer&aelig;</i>, and <i>Cycadace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The Gymnosperms also possess peculiarities of a subordinate
nature: thus, many kinds have more than two
cotyledons, and are therefore termed <i>polycotyledons</i>; again,
the radicle usually adheres to the albumen in which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"> 61 </a></span>
embryo lies, hence they are sometimes named <i>Synorhiza</i>.
The veins of the leaves (in those whose leaves are veined),
are either simple or forked; in which respect they approach
the endogens on the one hand, and the acrogens on the
other.</p>

<p>This concise definition of the natural divisions of the
vegetable kingdom will enable the reader to comprehend the
botanical principles which must guide him in his attempt to
explore the ancient floras, whose fossil remains are generally
found in a very fragmentary condition.</p>

<p>I need only add that M. Ad. Brongniart, in his great
work on Fossil Plants, arranges the vegetable kingdom into
five classes, viz.:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Cellular Cryptogamia,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> or Amphigens.</p>

<p>2. Vascular Cryptogamia,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> or Acrogens.</p>

<p class="caption3">ON THE MODE OF INVESTIGATING FOSSIL REMAINS OF VEGETABLES.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INVESTIGATION OF FOSSIL PLANTS.</div>

<p>The distinguished authors of the British Fossil Flora
justly remark, that a few isolated, and very imperfect data,
exclusively afforded by the remains of the organs of vegetation,
are but too often the sole guide to the class, order, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"> 62 </a></span>
genus of the fossil plants which the geologist has to examine;
hence, in most instances, a general idea only can be obtained
of the nature of the original.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> To facilitate the study of
Fossil Botany they offer some practical suggestions, which
have served as the basis of the following directions for the
investigation of vegetable remains, and which the previous
remarks will, we trust, render intelligible.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>1. <i>The Trunk, or Stem.</i>&mdash;Examine if the wood in a transverse
section be disposed in concentric circles (as <a href="#Plate_V"><i>Plate V.
fig 4</i></a>): if so, it belonged to an exogenous tree: if, on the contrary,
the wood appears deposited irregularly in spots (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1,
fig. 4</i></a>), then the original was endogenous. If a transverse section
show remains of sinuous, unconnected layers, resembling
arcs with their ends directed outwards, and of a solid structure,
and imbedded among looser tissue, then it belonged to
an arborescent fern; see the subjoined figures (<a href="#lign_2"><i>Lign. 2</i></a>).</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 500px;">

<p>Transverse sections (half the diameter) of two stems of recent Arborescent Ferns,
to show the zone of woody fibre disposed in arcs. This structure is seen in the
silicified trunks from Chemnitz.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">INVESTIGATION OF FOSSIL STEMS.</div>

<p>If the stem be in a state of preservation that will admit
of the slicing or chipping off a piece for microscopical investigation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"> 63 </a></span>
the process described at the conclusion of this
section should be employed.</p>

<p>The following data may be thus obtained. If the structure
be entirely cellular, and it can be satisfactorily ascertained
that it never possessed vascular tissue, the original
belonged to the <i>Cryptogamia</i>; <i>i.e.</i> to fuci, mosses, and
the like.</p>

<p>If it consist of parallel tubes, and has neither pith, nor
rays passing from the centre to the circumference, the tree
or plant was <i>endogenous</i>, like the Palm. If any trace be
present of tissue crossing the longitudinal tubes at right
angles, and radiating from the centre to the circumference,
this will prove the existence of medullary rays, and the
original must have been <i>exogenous</i>, as the Oak, Elm, &amp;c.:
and if in a transverse section the tubes appear of equal size,
the tree was probably <i>coniferous</i>, or <i>cycadeous</i> (<i>i.e.</i> related to
the plants called <i>Cycas</i> and <i>Zamia</i>); but if larger tubes
appear among the smaller ones, disposed in a definite manner
(see <a href="#Plate_V"><i>Plate V. fig. 4</i></a>), it belonged to some other tribe of
exogenous plants.</p>

<p>If the walls of the tubes be studded with glands (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1,
fig. 1, c</i></a>; <a href="#Plate_V"><i>Plate V. figs. 2<sup>b</sup> 3<sup>b</sup></i></a>.); the fossil belongs to the
Conifer&aelig;.</p>

<p>If any vestige of a central pith be discovered, the exogenous
nature of the original is undoubted, for no other class,
as we previously stated, possesses a central cellular column.</p>

<p>The absence or presence of a true cortical investment, or
bark, is important, for a distinct bark is the characteristic of
the <i>exogenous</i> class:<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> a cortical integument, or rind, not
separable from the enclosed structure, indicates the <i>monocotyledons</i>;
and the entire absence of any rind, the <i>cryptogamia</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> An apparent exception to this rule is found in the fossil genus
Clathraria, described hereafter, which has a distinct hollow cortical
cylinder, that separates from the internal axis: this is not true
bark, but is formed by the consolidation of the bases of the petioles
or leaf-stalks; see <a href="#lign_54"><i>Lign. 54</i></a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"> 64 </a></span></p></div>

<p>The markings on the stems, occasioned by the scars or
cicatrices left by the separation of the petioles or leaf-stalks
(as on the stalk of a cabbage), afford important evidence,
since they are commonly present, even when the cylindrical
trunk is compressed into a flat thin layer of coal; as
we shall often have occasion to remark. In this place it
need only be stated, that by these scars may be detected
the position of the leaves, and the form of the bases of the
petioles or leaf-stalks; their probable direction, whether they
were opposite, alternate, verticillate or spirally disposed,
deciduous or persistent, imbricated or remote. Even when
no traces of the leaves remain, the origin of the branches,
and their bifurcation, may perhaps be determinable.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Leaves.</i>&mdash;In a fossil state the texture and surface
of the leaves are sometimes preserved; but in general the
outline of the leaf, its division and arrangement, and its
mode of venation, can alone be ascertained. The <i>venation</i>,
that is, the form and distribution of the vascular tissue, or
vessels, through the leaf, is the most important character for
our guidance; and Dr. Lindley offers the following suggestions
on this point. If the veins be all parallel, not branched,
or only connected by little transverse bars, and the leaves
undivided (as in the Lily or Hyacinth), the plant was probably
endogenous; but if the leaf be divided or pinnated, it
may be referable to Cycade&aelig; (<a href="#lign_45"><i>Lign. 45</i></a>).</p>

<p>Leaves having the veins of equal, or nearly equal thickness,
and dichotomous (<i>forked</i>), or very fine, and simply
divided, belong to the fern tribe; to this division an immense
proportion of the foliage found in the carboniferous strata is
referable; the genera of fossil ferns have been constructed
principally from the venation.</p>

<p>If the veins of a leaf be obviously of unequal thickness,
and reticulated, or disposed in net-like meshes, as in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"> 65 </a></span>
rose and apple, the original was dicotyledonous (<a href="#Plate_III"><i>Plate III,
figs. 4, 8</i></a>).</p>

<p>Leaves of a large size, destitute of veins, and irregularly
divided, probably belong to fuci, or other marine plants
(<a href="#lign_10"><i>Lign.</i> 10</a>).</p>

<p>Such are the rules for the investigation and interpretation
of the characters of stems and foliage, which have been
preserved by mineralization. Their application is not difficult,
and the student may by their assistance obtain some
general indications as to the nature of the original trees or
plants, whose petrified remains form the subject of his examination.</p>


<p class="caption3">ON THE MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF FOSSIL VEGETABLES.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.</div>

<p>Mr. Nicol, who first suggested the method now generally
adopted for preparing fossil wood, coal, &amp;c. for microscopical
examination, and which was employed by Mr. Witham in
the illustrations of his beautiful work on the structure of
fossil plants,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> has so clearly explained the process, that by a
little practice the student will be able to prepare specimens
sufficiently thin for every useful purpose. Several lapidaries
in London, (see list at the end of this work,) polish and
mount fossil vegetables and other substances, in a very superior
manner; but their charges are high, and they frequently
injure specimens by grinding them too thin, and thus obliterating
structure. I would recommend that a small chip
of the specimen, if possible in a <i>radial</i> direction, should be
examined by reflected light, always beginning with the
lowest object-glass and eye-piece, and ascending to the
highest power; at first without any preparation;<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> subsequently
the object should be immersed in oil of turpentine,
which will render it somewhat transparent, and it then
should be examined by transmitted light. By this exploration
we may detect structure, and ascertain if the specimen
be worth the trouble or expense of further preparation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Observations on Fossil Vegetables. 4to. 1833.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"> 66 </a></span></p></div>

<p>Coal may be prepared for examination, by removing with
a sharp knife a thin pellicle, or a minute scraping; immerse
it in a drop of oil of turpentine on a piece of glass; then add
a little Canada balsam, and hold the glass over the flame of
a lamp till the balsam is spread evenly over the specimen.
But without any preparation, the surface of coal recently
broken may be successfully investigated. One of the most
interesting examples of coniferous structure in coal that my
cabinet contains, was discovered by my son in a piece lying
on the fire, which had been cracked by the heat; and I
have another fragment, showing the spiral vessels, and coniferous
glands, which the Rev. J. B. Reade obtained under
similar circumstances. But for choice specimens, the following
method is to be employed; and in many cases no
other plan will succeed. Sections of teeth, bone, marble, &amp;c.
may be prepared by a like process.</p>


<p class="caption3">MODE OF PREPARING SLICES OF FOSSIL WOOD FOR
MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION.</p>

<p>"Let a thin slice be cut off from the fossil wood, in a
direction perpendicular to the length of its fibres&mdash;the slice
thus obtained must be ground perfectly flat, and polished.
The polished surface is then to be cemented to a piece of
plate glass (3 in. long and 1 in. wide) by Canada balsam&mdash;a
thin layer of balsam must be applied to the polished surface
of the slice, and also to one side of the glass&mdash;the slice
and the glass are now to be laid on any thin plate of metal,
and gradually heated over a slow fire, or a spirit lamp, to
concentrate the balsam. The heat must not be so great as
to throw the balsam into a state of ebullition; for if air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"> 67 </a></span>
bubbles be formed, it is difficult to get rid of them, and if
not removed they will prevent the complete adhesion of the
two surfaces when applied to each other; the heat of the
metal should never be so great that the fingers may not be
held in contact with it for a few seconds without inconvenience.
When air bubbles are formed, they should be displaced
by a small piece of wood tapering to a point; when the
balsam is thought to be sufficiently concentrated, and all the
air bubbles have disappeared, the slice and glass may be
taken from the heated metal, and pressed closely together;
a slight degree of pressure will suffice to expel the super-abundant
balsam, and this will be facilitated by gently
sliding the specimen to and fro on the glass; by this kind
of motion any air that may have got entangled when the
two surfaces were brought in contact, will also be removed.
When the whole is cooled down to the temperature of the
air, and the balsam has become solid, that part which
adheres to the surface of the glass surrounding the slice
should be scraped off with the point of a penknife; and by
this operation, it will at once be seen whether the balsam
has undergone the requisite concentration; for if it flakes
off before the knife, it will be found that the slice and glass
will cohere so firmly, that in the subsequent grinding, there
will be no risk of their separating from each other; but if
the balsam has not been sufficiently concentrated, it will
slide before the knife, and in that case the two bodies will
not adhere with requisite firmness. If the layer of balsam
applied to the two surfaces be not too thick, its due concentration
will be accomplished in four or five minutes, provided
the application of the heat be properly regulated. The slice
must now be ground to that degree of thinness which will
permit its structure to be seen by the help of a microscope.
This will be accomplished by rubbing the slice, by a rapid
circular motion with the hand, on a piece of sheet lead, supplied
with a little emery (<i>size</i> No. 1.) moistened with water;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"> 68 </a></span>
when the emery ceases to act, the muddy matter remaining
should be removed, and a fresh portion of emery applied;
this must be repeated until the surface of the slice is perfectly
flat; a sheet of copper must then be substituted for
the lead, and the fossil ground as smooth as possible by
flower of emery, freed from its coarser parts. The surface
may then be polished by friction, with <i>crocus</i> or rotten stone,
on a transverse section of any soft wood."<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Before entering upon the examination of the specific and
generic characters of fossil plants, and the natural relations
of the extinct forms with those of the existing Floras, it
will be requisite to notice those vast beds of vegetable
matter, in various states of carbonization, which occur in
the pal&aelig;ozoic, secondary, and tertiary formations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"> 70 </a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Submerged Forests. Peat.</span>&mdash;The phenomenon of extensive
tracts of marsh-land, with layers of prostrate trees of
all ages, lying but a few feet beneath the common alluvial
soil, is of frequent occurrence, both inland, and in many
places along the shores of our island. (<i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 18).
These submerged forests are generally situated below the
level of the sea, and afford unquestionable proof of subsidences
of the land. The trees are of the kinds indigenous
to the districts in which they occur; and leaves and seeds of
the hazel, beech, elm, &amp;c. are often preserved in the silt in
which the prostrate forests are imbedded. On the Sussex
coast there are accumulations of this kind, at Bexhill,
Pevensey levels, Felpham, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The extensive subterranean forests exposed in the Fens
of Lincolnshire by the operations carried on for draining
that district, must be familiar to those who travel by the
Great Northern Railway: the protruding upright stems,
broken off at a short distance above the primitive soil, will
remind the geological observer of the petrified forest of the
Isle of Portland.</p>

<p>The wood in these cases has undergone no change but
that of being dyed black, by an impregnation of solutions
of iron; and many trunks are in so sound a state as to
be employed in building. The oak timbers of the Royal
George, lately raised up from off Portsmouth, after being
immersed in silt about sixty years, closely resemble in colour
and texture the wood of the submerged forests. Skeletons of
deer, horse, swine, &amp;c. are occasionally found imbedded in
these subterranean accumulations of vegetable remains; and
sometimes canoes, formed of the trunk of an oak, constructed
by the aboriginal inhabitants of Britain, with stone implements
called celts, are met with at considerable depths.</p>

<p>In the peat-bogs of Ireland (<i>Wond.</i> p. 66), large forest
trees often occur, together with the skeletons of the elk,
deer, and other animals of the chase; and in a few instances
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"> 71 </a></span>
the bodies of the primitive hunters, wrapped in skins, have
been discovered.</p>

<p>In Belfast Lough, a bed of peat is situated beneath
the ordinary level of the waters, but is generally left bare
at the ebb tides. Trunks and branches of trees, with vast
quantities of hazel nuts, are imbedded in the peat; the
whole being covered by layers of sand, and blue clay, or
silt. In most cases the pericarps of the nuts are empty,
the kernels having perished; but on the eastern side of
the Lough, which is bounded by limestone rocks, they
contain calc-spar, which in some examples forms a lining of
delicate crystals (<i>Plate V. fig. 6</i>); while in others the kernel
is transmuted into calcareous spar (see <i>Plate III. fig. 7</i>);
but the pericarps are unchanged, and in the state of common
dried nut-shells; the water which deposited the spar in
their cavities not having left a particle of mineral matter in
the ligneous substance through which it had filtrated.</p>

<p>In a subterranean forest at Ferry-bridge, Yorkshire, hazel
nuts in a similar mineralized state occur, and the branches
and stems of the trees have undergone a like change; the
central ligneous axis is petrified, while the outer zones have
undergone no lapidification, but remain in the state of dry
rotten wood.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_46" id="Footnote_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Specimens are preserved in the Museum at York.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">PEAT.&mdash;LIGNITE.&mdash;BROWN COAL.</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Lignite, Brown Coal, or Cannel Coal</span>; these are terms
employed to designate certain varieties of carbonized wood,
in which the ligneous structure is more or less distinctly
preserved. Lignite may be regarded as an imperfect coal,
for in its chemical properties it holds an intermediate place
between peat and bituminous coal. It is for the most part
found in tertiary formations, but is not unfrequent in
ancient secondary deposits, and may occur in the earliest
sedimentary rocks which contain vegetable remains.</p>

<p>The newer deposits of <i>Brown or wood-coal</i>, are commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"> 72 </a></span>
situated in depressions or basins, as if they had been produced
by the submergence of woods and forests, in a swamp
or morass; and in many instances the ligneous structure
is distinct in one part of the bed, while in another the mass
is a pure black coal, differing in no respect from true coal,
except that it is less dense.</p>

<p><i>Bovey Coal.</i>&mdash;One of the most instructive deposits of brown
coal in England, is that of Bovey Heathfield, near Chudleigh
in Devonshire, which is of considerable thickness and extent,
and presents all the characters of a true coal-field; namely,
beds of carbonized vegetables, alternating with layers of
clay and marl. The Bovey coal is in the state of bituminized
wood, the vascular tissue (which is coniferous in the
specimens that have come under my notice) being apparent.
It is easily chipped or split, and leaves a considerable
quantity of white ashes after combustion. The layers of
coal vary in thickness from one foot to three feet; and
there are eighteen or twenty in a depth of about 120 feet;
this coal-field extends seven or eight miles. No leaves or
fruits have been discovered; bitumen occurs both in the
coal and in the intermediate clays. Calcareous spar, and
iron pyrites, prevail in many of the strata. In some places
this brown coal is covered by a bed of peat, in which trunks
and cones of firs are imbedded. The whole series appears
to have been a lacustrine deposit; probably formed in a
lake, into whose basin rafts of pine forests were drifted by
periodical land-floods. (Org. Rem. I. p. 327).</p>

<p>The brown-coal formations on the banks of the Rhine,
present the same phenomena on a more extended scale, and
complicated with changes induced by volcanic action. In
Iceland, where at the present time forests are unknown, there
are extensive deposits of lignite of a peculiar kind, termed
<i>surturbrand</i>.</p>


<div class="sidenote">JET.&mdash;WEALDEN COAL.</div>

<p><i>Jet.</i>&mdash;The beautiful substance called Jet, is a compact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"> 73 </a></span>
lignite, and the vascular tissue may be detected even in the
most solid masses; when prepared in very thin slices, it
appears of a rich brown colour by transmitted light, and the
woody texture is visible to the naked eye. Jet is found in
great purity and abundance in the cliffs of alum-shale on
the Yorkshire coast, which were celebrated in the early
centuries for the production of this substance. At Whitby
and Scarborough extensive manufactories of ornaments and
trinkets of jet are established. The sandstone cliffs near
Whitby contain masses of a very compact variety, locally
termed stone-jet. In the front of the cliff, on the north-west
side of Haiburn Wyke, the stump of a tree was
observed in an erect position, about three feet high, and
fifteen inches in diameter; the roots traversed a bed of shale,
and were in the state of coarse jet, but the trunk, which
extended into the sandstone, was in part silicified, while other
portions were decayed and had a sooty aspect.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Thin seams and layers, and nodular masses, as well as
regular coal-fields of lignite, occur in the tertiary formations.
At Castle Hill, near Newhaven, in Sussex (<i>Wond.</i> p. 239),
a seam of lignite resembling the surturbrand of Iceland, a
few inches thick, is interposed between strata of red marl
in which are carbonized leaves of dicotyledonous trees.</p>

<p>At Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight, a layer of lignite
occurs between the beds of vertical gravel and sand of that
interesting locality.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Wealden Coal.</span>&mdash;The Wealden formation, in some
districts, contains layers of lignite, which alternate with
finely laminated micaceous sandstones, marls, and clays,
abounding in minute carbonized fragments of fern-leaves,
with fresh-water shells, and entomostracous crustaceans.
This series of strata so strikingly resembles in its general
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"> 74 </a></span>
aspect the characters of a coal-field, that some years since
extensive works were undertaken in Sussex, in the expectation
that coal might be obtained of suitable quality for
economical purposes. The search was unsuccessful, but the
attempt deserves not the censure that was bestowed upon it,
in the infancy of geological science;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> for experience has
since shown, that although the true coal-measures are
only found beneath the Triassic and Permian formations,
good combustible bituminous coal is not necessarily restricted
to any period or series of strata, but may occur
wherever the local conditions were favourable to the accumulation
and bituminization of vegetable matter. In fact,
the coal-fields of the north of Germany are of the Wealden
epoch; and this coal more closely approaches in its chemical
characters the black-coal of the ancient carboniferous
formations, than any of the lignites and brown-coals of
the tertiary strata. Some of the beds are highly bituminous,
especially those of Schaumberg, and of the principality of
B&uuml;ckeburg, which may rank with the best English Newcastle
coal; but those layers which are derived from coniferous
trees and plants are more laminated, and somewhat resemble
the brown-coal. These deposits have originated for the
most part from carbonized conifers and cycads, with a few
ferns and lycopodiace&aelig;, or club-mosses.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> See Sir J. F. W. Herschel's Discourse on Nat. Phil.</p></div>

<p>The brown-coal of Hohen-Warte by the Osterweld, is
chiefly formed of the <i>Abies Linkii</i>, and <i>Pterophyllum
Lyellianum</i>, whose leaves and twigs, closely impacted
together, are generally of a brownish colour, have a glossy
surface, and, when soaked in water, are perfectly flexible.
The other modification of Wealden coal appears to have
undergone a greater degree of pressure, and of exclusion
from the atmosphere; no ligneous structure is apparent,
but indistinct impressions of leaves are perceptible, and
these are chiefly of ferns and club-mosses. This coal has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"> 75 </a></span>
probably resulted from an accumulation of plants of less
firm texture, and more perishable, than those of which the
former is composed.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_49" id="Footnote_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> See Dr. Bunker's Mon. Norddeutsch. Weald.</p></div>

<p>Many interesting facts relating to the carbonization of
vegetables, came under my observation during my researches
in the Wealden strata; and it is a subject of regret to me,
that circumstances prevented my following up the investigation
of those still imperfectly explored deposits. Small
nodular portions of coal, in which no structure is apparent,
often occur in the calciferous grit of Tilgate Forest;
and sometimes large masses of lignite, fissured in every
direction, and having the interstices filled with white calcareous
spar.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Some of the sandstones are discoloured
by the abundance of minute particles of lignite, produced
by the disintegration of ferns peculiar to the country of the
Iguanodon.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_50" id="Footnote_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> A fine specimen of this kind is in the British Museum.</p></div>

<p>The original structure and composition of a plant doubtless
affected its carbonization; for in the same layer of stone,
the stems of Endogenites, hereafter described, invariably
possess a thick, outer crust, of coal; while those of Clathrari&aelig;,
plants allied to the Cycads, have not a particle of carbonaceous
matter, but are surrounded by a reddish brown
earthy substance. The nature of the stratum in which
the plants were imbedded, must also have influenced the
process of bituminization. Masses of vegetables buried
beneath beds of tenacious clay, by which the escape of the
gaseous elements set free by decomposition was prevented,
must have been placed under the most favourable conditions
for their conversion into lignite and coal.</p>

<p>That the production of lignite is still going on there can
be no doubt; and the following instance of a bed of recent
origin, affords an instructive illustration of the subject
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"> 76 </a></span>.
Near Limerick, in the district of Maine, one of the States of
North America, there are peat-bogs of considerable extent,
in which a substance similar to cannel-coal is found at the
depth of three or four feet from the surface, amidst the
remains of rotten logs of wood, and <i>beaver-sticks</i>:<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> the peat
is twenty feet thick, and rests upon white sand. This coal
was discovered on digging a ditch to drain a portion of the
bog, for the purpose of obtaining peat for manure. The
substance is a true bituminous coal, containing more bitumen
than is found in any other variety,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Polished sections of
the compact masses exhibit the peculiar structure of coniferous
trees, and prove that the coal was derived from a
species allied to the American fir.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COAL.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Coal.</span>&mdash;We proceed to the examination of that remarkable
substance which has resulted from the perfect bituminization
of the vegetables of the most ancient Flora which
geological researches have brought to light, and to which
the term <i>Coal</i> is commonly restricted.</p>

<p>Although Balthazar Klein in the sixteenth century
affirmed that coal owed its formation to wood and other
vegetable substances,<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> yet I can well remember when many
eminent geologists were sceptical on this point; and the
truth in this, as in most other questions of natural philosophy,
was established with difficulty. The experiments
and observations of the late Dr. Macculloch, mainly contributed
to solve the problem as to the vegetable nature of
this substance; and that eminent chemist and geologist
successfully traced the transition of vegetable matter from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"> 77 </a></span>
peat-wood, brown-coal, lignite, and jet, to coal, anthracite,
graphite, and plumbago. Nor must the meritorious labours
of that accomplished naturalist, and excellent man, the
late Mr. Parkinson, author of the "<i>Organic Remains of
a Former World</i>," in this field of research, be forgotten.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
The first volume of that work, which treats on fossil plants,
contains much original information on the transmutation of
vegetables into the various mineral substances in which the
nature and original structure of the originals are altogether
changed and obliterated; it may still be consulted by the
student with advantage.</p>

<p>Although the vegetable origin of all coal will not admit
of question, yet evidence of the internal organization of the
plants of which it is composed, is not always attainable; for
the most perfect coal has undergone a complete liquefaction,
and if any portions of the structure remain, they appear
under the microscope as if imbedded in a pure bituminous
mass. The slaty coal generally preserves traces of cellular
or vascular tissue, and the spiral vessels, and the dotted
cells of coniferous trees, may readily be detected in
chips or slices, prepared in the manner previously pointed
out (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_66">p. 66</a>.). In many examples the cells are filled
with an amber-coloured resinous substance; in others the
organization is so well preserved, that on the exposed
surface of a piece of coal cracked by exposure to heat, the
vascular tissue, spiral vessels, and cells studded with glands,
may be detected. Even in the white ashes left after combustion,
traces of the spiral vessels are often discernible
under a highly magnifying powder. Some beds of coal are
wholly composed of minute leaves and disintegrated foliage;
and if a mass recently extracted from the mine be split
asunder, the surface is seen to be covered with flexible
pellicles of carbonized leaves and fibres, matted together;
and flake after flake may be peeled off through a thickness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"> 78 </a></span>
of many inches, and the same structure be apparent.
Rarely are any large trunks or branches observable in the
coal; the appearance of many beds being that of a deposit
of foliage, shed and accumulated in a forest, (as may be
observable in existing pine-districts,) and consolidated by
pressure, while undergoing that peculiar change by which
vegetable matter is converted into a carbonaceous mass.</p>

<p>In fine, a gradual transition may be traced from the
peat-wood and submerged forests of modern times, in which
leaves, fruits, and trunks of indigenous trees and plants are
preserved, to those vast deposits of mineral coal, formed by
the bituminization of the extinct Floras which flourished
in the pal&aelig;ozoic ages.</p>

<p>The geological position of the ancient coal, the manner in
which it is interstratified with layers of clay, shale, micaceous
sandstone, grit, and ironstone&mdash;in some districts associated
with beds of fresh-water shells (<i>Sil. Syst.</i> p. 84)&mdash;in others
alternating with strata containing marine remains,&mdash;are fully
treated of in <i>Wond.</i> pp. 729-733, and <i>Bd.</i> p. 525; and it
is not within the scope of the present work to dwell in detail
upon what may be termed the physical geology of the carboniferous
deposits. But a few observations on the phenomena
presented by these accumulations of bituminized
vegetables and their associated strata, are necessary to
render the subsequent remarks on the habits and affinities
of the plants composing the pal&aelig;ozoic Flora intelligible to
the general reader.</p>

<p>While the essential conditions for the conversion of vegetable
substances into coal appear to be the imbedding of
large quantities of recent trees and plants in a deposit which
shall exclude the air, and prevent the escape of the gaseous
elements when released by decomposition from their organic
combination, so, according to the more or less perfect manner
in which these conditions are fulfilled, will result coal, jet,
lignite, brown-coal, or peat-wood; or a mass of partially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"> 79 </a></span>
carbonized vegetables, like that observable when new-mown
hay undergoes spontaneous combustion, from bituminous
fermentation in the atmosphere (<i>Wond.</i> p. 701. <i>Org. Rem.</i>
I. p. 181).</p>

<p>The manner in which the carboniferous strata have been
deposited, has been a subject of much discussion. Some
contend that the coal-measures were originally in the state
of peat-bogs, and that the successive layers were formed by
the subsidences of forests which grew on the sites now occupied
by their carbonized remains; others suppose that the
vegetable matter originated from rafts, like those of the
Mississippi, which floated out to sea, and became engulfed;
while many affirm that the coal-measures were accumulated in
inland seas or lakes, the successive beds of vegetable matter
being supplied by periodical land-floods; and the supporters
of each hypothesis bring numerous facts in corroboration of
their respective opinions. There can, I think, be no doubt
that the production of coal has taken place under each of
these conditions, and that at different periods, and in various
localities, all these causes have been in operation; in some
instances singly, in others in combination. Coal may have
been formed at the bottom of fresh-water lakes, as in those
instances where it is associated with fresh-water shells and
crustaceans, as at Burdie House (<i>Wond.</i> p. 693), and in
some of the Derbyshire and Yorkshire deposits; in the beds
of rivers and estuaries, as in the Wealden, and in the
Shrewsbury coal-field;<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and from drifted forests, like the
rafts of the American rivers, transported into the sea, and
engulfed in the abyss of the ocean;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> and the remains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"> 80 </a></span>
terrestrial, lacustrine, and marine animals, may accordingly
be found associated with it.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But though many coal-fields
(or basins, as they are termed, because they occupy depressions)
have evidently been produced by different, and local
agencies, the sedimentary deposits and coal-beds comprised
in the carboniferous formations, setting aside unimportant
variations, present a remarkable uniformity of character in
their nature and arrangement, not only throughout Great
Britain and Europe, but in every other part of the known
world.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55" id="Footnote_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> In this coal-field are beds of limestone several feet thick, abounding
in cyprides, fresh-water mollusks, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Sil. Syst.</i> p, 84.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_56" id="Footnote_56"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> The immense thicknesss of some coal-beds, without any intercalations
of earthy materials, seems to be inexplicable on any other
supposition but that of accumulations of drift-wood and plants. In
the Great Exhibition of 1851, there was exhibited, on the outside of
the west end of the Crystal Palace, a section of the lowest bed of
coal from Tividale Colliery in South Staffordshire, the total thickness
of which was 29 feet, with no intermixture whatever of sediment,
except some thin shaly partings: the entire mass was composed of
carbonized vegetables.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STRATIFICATION OF A COAL-FIELD.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stratification of a Coal-field.</span>&mdash;The group of strata
constituting a coal-field consists of an alternation of layers
of coal and of clay, of variable thickness, resting, very generally,
on grit, or marine limestone abounding in shells,
corals, and crinoidea.</p>

<p>My late excellent friend, Mr. Bakewell, used to exemplify
the manner in which the beds of coal are interstratified with
layers of clay and shale, by the following apt illustration;
let a series of mussel-shells be placed one within the other,
and a layer of clay be interposed between each; the shells
will represent the beds of coal, and the partitions of clay the
earthy strata intercalated between the carboniferous layers;
now, if one side of the series of shells be raised to indicate
the general rise of the strata in that direction, and the whole
be dislocated by partial cracks and fissures, the general
arrangement and subsequent displacement of the beds will
be represented.</p>

<p>The principal feature which arrests attention on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"> 81 </a></span>
examination of the section of a coal-pit, is the uniform
presence of a thick bed of clay beneath every layer of coal;
but a still more extraordinary fact remains to be mentioned,
namely, that a common plant of the coal strata, called Stigmaria,
(hereafter described, see <i>Lign.</i> <a href="#lign_36">36</a>, <a href="#lign_38">38</a>,) invariably
occurs, more or less abundantly, in this bed of under-day,
although very rarely to be met with in the coal or shale
above. This phenomenon, long since noticed by Martin,
Macculloch, and other authors, but whose value was not duly
estimated till the recent observations of Mr. Logan, (<i>Geol.
Proc.</i> vol. iii. p. 275,) is also found to prevail throughout
the Welsh coal formation, which is upwards of twelve thousand
feet in thickness, and contains more than sixty beds
of coal, and as many of clay with stigmari&aelig;; the Appalachian
coal-measures of the United States present the same
characters.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> To place this fact before the student in a clear
point of view, I will describe one of the triple series of beds
which compose a coal-field.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_58" id="Footnote_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> See Prof. Rogers, in the Proceedings of the American Geologists,
p. 453; and Sir C. Lyell's Travels in America.</p></div>

<p>1. <i>Under-clay</i>; the lowermost stratum. A tough argillaceous
substance, which upon drying becomes a grey friable
earth: it is occasionally black, from the presence of carbonaceous
matter. It contains innumerable stems of stigmari&aelig;,
which are generally of considerable length, and have their
rootlets or fibres (see <a href="#lign_38"><i>Lign. 38</i></a>) attached, and extending in
every direction through the clay: these stems commonly
lie parallel with the planes of the bed, and nearer to the
top than to the bottom.</p>

<p>2. <i>Coal.</i> A carbonized mass, in which the external
forms of the plants and trees composing it are obliterated,
but the internal structure remains; large trunks or stems,
and leaves, are rarely distinguishable in it, but the presence
of coniferous wood in many beds of coal, proves that this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"> 82 </a></span>
arises, not from the absence of trees, but from their external
forms having been obliterated.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Roof</i>, or upper bed. This generally consists of
slaty clay, abounding in leaves, trunks, stems, branches, and
fruits, and contains layers and nodules of ironstone, inclosing
leaves, insects, crustaceans, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In some localities beds of fresh-water mussels, and in others
of marine shells, are intercalated; layers of shale, finely laminated
clay, micaceous sand and grit, and pebbles of limestone,
granite, sandstone, and other rocks, are often present. The
most illustrative examples of the foliage of the carboniferous
flora are found in this deposit, which appears to be an
accumulation of drifted materials derived from other rocks,
and promiscuously intermingled with the dense foliage and
stems of a prostrate forest; the whole having been transported
from a distance by a powerful current or flood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ORIGIN AND NATURE OF COAL.</div>

<p>Thus we have, in the first place, spread uniformly over
the bottom, and constituting the bed on which the coal
reposes, a stratum of clay (<i>Under-clay</i>), composed of fine
pulverulent materials, which may have once constituted the
soil of a vast plain or savannah; the only remains found in
it are the roots of gigantic trees (see <a href="#lign_36"><i>Lign. 36</i></a>); for such
the stigmari&aelig; are now proved to have been, and not aquatic
plants, as was formerly supposed (<i>Bd.</i> p. 476).</p>

<p>Secondly, a bituminous mass (Coal), composed of coniferous
wood, gigantic ferns, club-mosses, &amp;c.; occasionally
with trunks of trees penetrating vertically through it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a deposit of drift or water-worn materials (<i>the
Roof</i>), mixed with the foliage and stems of numerous species
of terrestrial plants; the whole appearing to have been
subjected to the action of currents. The first, or <i>Under-clay</i>,
may have been the natural soil, in which the stigmari&aelig;
grew; the next,&mdash;the <i>Coal</i>,&mdash;the carbonized stems, and
other remains of the trees to which the roots belonged: and
the last, or uppermost, forming the roof of the coal, may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"> 83 </a></span>
have resulted from the foliage and branches of a prostrate
forest, overwhelmed and buried beneath the transported
detritus of distant rocks.</p>

<p>These phenomena may be explained by supposing the
inundation of a thickly-wooded plain from an irruption of
the sea; or of a vast inland lake, occasioned by the sudden
removal of some barrier; or by a subsidence of the tract of
country on which the forest grew. But when we find an
accumulation of strata, in which triple deposits of this
kind are repeated some thirty or forty times through a
thickness of many thousand feet, this solution of the problem
is not satisfactory. Not only subsidence after subsidence
must have taken place, but the first submergence
have been followed by an elevation of the land&mdash;another soil,
fit for the growth of forest trees, must have been produced&mdash;another
generation of vegetables, of precisely the same
species and genera, have sprung up, and arrived at maturity&mdash;and
then another subsidence, and another accumulation
of drift. And these periodical oscillations in the relative
level of the land and water must have gone on uninterruptedly
through a long period of time, not in one district
or country only, but in various parts of the world, during
the same geological epoch. At present I do not think we
have data sufficient to explain these phenomena; what has
been advanced may, perhaps, serve to elicit further information,
by pointing out the difficulties in which the question
is involved, and showing what interesting fields of discovery
are still unexplored, and how comprehensive and important
are the objects that come within the scope of geological
investigation.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I will conclude this chapter with the following beautiful
reflections of Dr. Buckland on the origin and nature of Coal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"> 84 </a></span>
and the changes it undergoes when rendered subservient to
the necessities and luxuries of man.</p>

<p>"Few persons are aware of the remote and wonderful
events in the economy of our planet, and of the complicated
applications of human industry and science, which are involved
in the production of the coal that supplies with fuel
the metropolis of England.</p>

<p>"The most early stage to which we can carry back its
origin, was among the swamps and forests of the primeval
earth, where it flourished in the form of gigantic Calamites,
and stately <i>Lepidodendra</i>, and <i>Sigillari&aelig;</i>. From their
native bed, these plants were transported into some adjacent
lake, or estuary, or sea. Here they floated on the waters,
until they sank saturated to the bottom, and being buried
in the detritus of adjacent lands, became transferred to a
new estate among the members of the mineral kingdom.
A long interment followed, during which a course of
chemical changes, and new combinations of their vegetable
elements, converted them to the mineral condition of coal.
By the elevating force of subterranean agency, these beds
of coal have been uplifted from beneath the waters, to a
new position in the hills and mountains, where they are
accessible to the industry of man. From this fourth stage,
coal has been removed by the labours of the miner, assisted
by the arts and sciences, that have co-operated to produce
the steam-engine, and the safety-lamp. Returned once more
to the light of day, and a second time committed to the
waters, it has, by the aid of navigation, been conveyed to
the scene of its next and most considerable change by fire;
a change during which it becomes subservient to the most
important wants and conveniences of man. In this seventh
stage of its long eventful history, it seems, to the vulgar eye,
to undergo annihilation; its elements are, indeed, released
from the mineral combinations which they have maintained
for ages, but their apparent destruction is only the commencement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"> 85 </a></span>
of new successions of change and of activity.
Set free from their long imprisonment, they return to their
native atmosphere, from which they were absorbed by the
primeval vegetation of the earth. To-morrow they may
contribute to the substance of timber, in the trees of our
existing forests; and having for a while resumed their place
in the living vegetable kingdom, may, ere long, be applied
a second time to the use and benefit of man. And when
decay or fire shall once more consign them to the earth, or
to the atmosphere, the same elements will enter on some
further department of their perpetual ministration in the
economy of the material world."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL VEGETABLES.</p>



<p>In the present section of this work, I propose to explain
the botanical arrangement and nomenclature of fossil plants;
and figure and describe one or more species of the genera
that are most likely to come under the observation of the
student, either in public or private collections, or in the
course of his researches in the field.</p>

<p>To determine the botanical relations of fossil leaves and
stems, reference must be had to works expressly devoted to the
subject; namely, the "<i>British Fossil Flora</i>," by Dr. Lindley
and Mr. Hutton, and the "<i>Histoire des V&eacute;g&eacute;taux Fossiles</i>,"
by M. Adolphe Brongniart. The classification of the last-named
eminent botanist is here adopted, as the most easy of
application.</p>

<p>With regard to the nomenclature, it may be necessary to
remark, that when a fossil plant undoubtedly belongs to a
recent genus, the usual botanical name is employed: for
example, <i>Equisetum Lyellii</i>; when the fossil does not possess
all the generic characters, yet is evidently allied to
a recent genus, the term <i>ites</i> (from &#955;&#953;&#952;&#959;&#962;, <i>lithos</i>, stone), is
added&mdash;as <i>Equisetites</i>, <i>Palmacites</i>, &amp;c.; and this termination
is invariably adopted by some authors. When the
fossil plant differs altogether from any known type, it is distinguished
by some arbitrary generic name, as <i>Bucklandia</i>,
<i>Sigillaria</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There are also a few provisional genera for the reception
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"> 87 </a></span>
of fossil leaves, fruits, and stems, whose characters and relations
are but imperfectly known; as Carpolithes, Endogenites,
&amp;c. Upon these principles the present arrangement has
been founded: the progress of discovery will, of course, be
continually adding to the list, and the classification require
to be modified.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL CRYPTOGAMIA.</div>

<p>The following account of the principal types of the ancient
floras whose relics are preserved in the mineral kingdom,
though commencing with those of the most simple structure,
the <i>Cryptogamia</i>, and advancing to the higher orders,
is not strictly botanical; for it was found convenient, in
some instances, to notice certain species and genera of different
orders under the same head, from their occurrence in
the same geological formations.</p>

<p>It is estimated that not more than two thousand species
of plants have been discovered in a fossil state, while
the known recent species amount to upwards of eighty
thousand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cellular Cryptogamia; Alg&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The plants designated
by botanists <i>Alg&aelig;</i>, and commonly known as sea-weeds,
lavers, and fresh-water mosses, are of the most simple
structure&mdash;mere aggregations of cells&mdash;but present innumerable
varieties of form and magnitude: many species are
mere vesicles of such minuteness as to be invisible to the
unassisted eye, except accumulated in countless myriads,
when they appear as a green, purple, or reddish, slime in the
water; or as a film on wood or stone, or on the ground, in
damp situations; while others are tough branched marine
plants, many fathoms in length.</p>

<p>The Alg&aelig; form three principal groups: 1. the <i>jointless</i>, as
the Fuci, the Dulses, Tangles, and Lavers: 2. the <i>jointed</i>,
which are composed of thread-like articulated tubes; such
are the fresh-water Conferv&aelig;: 3. the <i>disjointed</i>, or Brittle-worts,
so called from their spontaneous self-division, which
is in some kinds complete, in others only partial; and these,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"> 88 </a></span>
by separating transversely, and leaving each cell or frustule
attached at the angles, produce those beautiful chains of
angular green transparent cases, so constantly seen under
the microscope when substances from fresh-water streams or
lakes are submitted to examination.</p>

<p>As many of these forms are endowed with spontaneous
motion, and possess other properties common to animal
organization, it is not surprising that their vegetable nature
was doubted, and that even so profound a naturalist as M.
Ehrenberg placed them in the animal kingdom: the greater
number being comprised in his family of <i>Bacillari&aelig;</i>, were
described in the former edition of this work, as Infusoria or
Animalcules; in conformity with the classification of the
illustrious microscopist, whose splendid works and indefatigable
labours have so greatly promoted the advancement of
microscopical investigation.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_61" id="Footnote_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> The whole of the objects called <i>Infusoria</i> in the first edition
of "The Medals of Creation" belong to various kinds of Diatomace&aelig;.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL DIATOMACE&AElig;.</div>

<p>These minute vegetable organisms are placed by botanists
in two tribes, the <i>Diatomace&aelig;</i> or the <i>Brittle-worts</i>, and the
<i>Desmidie&aelig;</i>. The latter are exclusively inhabitants of fresh-water,
while a large proportion of the former are marine
plants. Some naturalists (M. Br&eacute;bisson) restrict the name
<i>Diatomace&aelig;</i> to those species which secrete siliceous envelopes;
and that of <i>Desmidie&aelig;</i> to those whose structures are
not siliceous, and are reducible by heat to carbon. As the
durable parts of these plants alone concern the geologist, the
name <i>Diatomace&aelig;</i> will be employed as a general term in
reference to their fossil remains.</p>

<p>These tribes of Alg&aelig; abound in every lake and stream of
fresh-water, in every pool or bay, and throughout the ocean
from the equator to the poles. Certain kinds of sea-weeds
secrete carbonate of lime; but the Diatomace&aelig; have the
power of separating silex, or the earth of flint, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"> 89 </a></span>
water, by some unknown process, and their tissues are composed
of pure quartz: hence, under the microscope, their
remains, consisting wholly of rock crystal, exhibit the most
exquisite forms, elaborately fretted and ornamented (see
<a href="#lign_4"><i>Lign. 4</i></a>). After the death and decomposition of these plants,
their durable frustules or cases appear as colourless discs,
cups, spheres, shields, &amp;c., and these accumulate at the
bottom of the water in such inconceivable numbers, as to
form strata of great thickness and extent. Slowly, imperceptibly,
and incessantly, are the vital energies of these
atoms separating from the element in which they live the
most refractory and enduring of mineral substances, silex,
and elaborating it into imperishable structures, and thus
adding enormous contributions to the accumulations of
detritus, which make up the sedimentary rocks of the crust
of the globe.</p>

<p>The extent of this infinitesimal flora throughout regions
where no other forms of vegetation are known, is strikingly
demonstrated by the observations of our eminent botanical
traveller. Dr. Joseph Hooker, in his account of the Antarctic
regions.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_62" id="Footnote_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> "On the Botany of the South Polar Regions;" in Sir J. Ross's
Voyage of Discovery.</p></div>

<p>"Everywhere," Dr. Hooker states, "the waters and the
ice alike abound in these microscopic vegetables. Though
too small to be visible to the unassisted eye, their aggregated
masses stained the iceberg and pack-ice wherever the
latter were washed by the sea, and imparted a pale ochreous
colour to the ice. From the south of the belt of ice which
encircles the globe, to the highest latitudes reached by man,
this vegetation is everywhere conspicuous, from the contrast
between its colour and that of the white snow and ice in
which it is imbedded.</p>

<p>"In the 80&deg; of south latitude all the surface ice carried
along by currents, and the sides of every berg, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"> 90 </a></span>
base of the great Victoria barrier itself&mdash;a perpendicular
wall of ice, from one to two hundred feet above the sea
level&mdash;were tinged brown from this cause, as if the waters
were charged with oxide of iron. The majority of these
plants consist of simple vegetable cells enclosed in indestructible
silex; and it is obvious that the death of such
multitudes must form sedimentary deposits of immense
extent.</p>

<p>"The universal existence of such an invisible vegetation
as that of the Antarctic Ocean is a truly wonderful fact, and
the more so from its being unaccompanied by plants of a
high order. This ocean swarms with mollusca, and entomostracous
crustaceans, small whales, and porpoises; and
the sea with penguins and seals, and the air with birds;
the animal kingdom is everywhere present, the larger creatures
preying on the smaller, and these again on those more
minute; all living nature seems to be carnivorous. This
microscopic vegetation is the sole nutrition of the herbivorous
animals; and it may likewise serve to purify the
atmosphere, and thus execute in the Antarctic latitudes the
office of the trees and grasses of the temperate regions, and
the broad foliage of the palms of the tropics."</p>

<p>Dr. Hooker also remarks that the siliceous envelopes of
the same kinds of diatomace&aelig; now living in the waters
of the South Polar Ocean, have contributed in past ages to
the formation of European strata; for the tripoli and the
phonolite stones of the Rhine, contain the siliceous envelopes
of identical species.</p>

<p>Such are the comments of one of our most distinguished
botanists, on the phenomena under review. The reader will
perhaps ask, what then are the essential characters which
separate the animal from the vegetable kingdom? To this
question it is impossible to give a satisfactory reply: perhaps
the only distinction that will be generally admitted by
zoologists and botanists is the following:&mdash;<i>animals require
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"> 91 </a></span>
organic substances for their support; vegetables derive their
sustenance from inorganic matter</i>.</p>


<div class="sidenote">RECENT DIATOMACE&AElig;.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Recent Diatomace&aelig;.</span> <i>Plate IV.</i>&mdash;To familiarize the
reader with the nature of these vegetable organisms, a few
recent species are represented in Plate IV., coloured as they
appear when alive, under the microscope; the figures are
magnified as expressed by the fractions.</p>

<p><i>Xanthidium.</i> <i>Plate IV. figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</i>&mdash;The case or
frustule of this genus consists of a hollow, siliceous globe,
beset with spines. The increase of the Xanthidia by self-division,
produces the double appearance in the figures, all
of which are in the progress of separation.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_63" id="Footnote_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> The organisms so abundant in the flint and chalk, and which
were referred by M. Ehrenberg to this genus, and consequently
described under the name of Xanthidia by myself and others, are
certainly in nowise related to the recent forms: they are flexible
envelopes, and probably belong to zoophytes; as will be shown in the
sequel.</p></div>

<p><i>Pyxidiculum.</i> <i>Plate IV. fig. 2.</i>&mdash;The case is a little
saucer-shaped box, and is invested by a membrane.</p>

<p><i>Bacillaria.</i> <i>Plate IV. fig. 6.</i>&mdash;A simple siliceous frustule,
of a prismatic shape, forming a brilliant chain, which often
appears in zigzag, in consequence of incomplete self-division.
An immense number and variety of forms are placed
in this family by Ehrenberg, with a multitude of generic
and specific names. The fresh-water species inhabit every
pond and lake, and the marine every sea. Fossil species
are equally abundant.</p>

<p><i>Cocconeis.</i> <i>Plate IV. fig. 7.</i>&mdash;This is a very elegant type;
the frustule consists of a simple siliceous case, with a central
opening; it never occurs in chains like the former. It has
been found fossil near Cassel.</p>

<p><i>Navicula.</i> <i>Plate IV. figs. 8, 9, 14, 15.</i>&mdash;The plants of
this genus are free, and float in the water apparently by the
agency of cilia. Their case is a boat-like envelope with six
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"> 92 </a></span>
openings, composed of pure silex, and in many species
is exquisitely ornamented. Figs. 8 and 9. show a living
<i>Navicula</i>, viewed in front, and in profile: in <i>fig.</i> 9 are
represented the currents produced when the body is moving
through the water; after Ehrenberg. Fossil <i>Navicul&aelig;</i>
abound in many tertiary strata.</p>

<p><i>Galionella.</i> <i>Plate IV. figs. 10, 11.</i>&mdash;These alg&aelig; are
free, and the frustules of a cylindrical, globular, or discoidal
form; they occur in chains, in consequence of the self-division
being imperfect, and the new individuals remaining
attached to the old. The <i>Galionell&aelig;</i> are most abundant
and prolific, and inhabit every pool, stream, and lake:
fossil species occur in the Virginian marls, and other
strata.</p>

<p><i>Synhedra.</i> <i>Plate IV. fig. 12.</i>&mdash;The frustules are siliceous,
and of a slender, elongated form. The plant is attached by
the base (<i>fig. 12 a.</i>) in youth, and afterwards becomes free.
It is found fossil in the Mountain-meal of Santa Flora, and
many other deposits.</p>

<p><i>Podosphenia.</i> <i>Plate IV. fig. 13.</i>&mdash;The frustule is cruciform,
or wedge-shaped, and attached in youth by the small
end, but afterwards becomes free. These plants are often
arranged in clusters, as in the figure. M. Ehrenberg
states that they inhabit the sea, and not fresh-water; but
I have found them in streams communicating with the
Thames. <i>Podospheni&aelig;</i> abound in the polishing slate of
Bilin.</p>

<p><i>Eunotia.</i> <i>Plate IV. figs. 16, 17.</i>&mdash;The frustule is siliceous,
and either simple or bivalve; flat below, and convex,
and often richly dentated above. An empty case is shown
<i>fig. 16</i>; and a group of living <i>Eunotice</i> attached to a stem
of conferva, <i>fig. 17</i>. Several fossil species have been discovered
at Santa Flora.</p>

<p>That the general reader, whose attention is for the first
time directed to this subject, may be prepared for the enormous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"> 93 </a></span>
deposits of fossil diatomace&aelig; that are found in some
formations, I subjoin the observations of Dr. Bailey on an
elegant fragile species, which hangs together in clusters,
appearing like spiral chains, and is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> of a line in
diameter; it is named <i>Meridion vernale</i>.</p>

<p>"This fresh-water plant is seen in immense quantities in
the mountain brooks around West Point, the bottoms of
which are literally covered in the first warm days of spring
with a ferruginous-coloured mucous matter, about a quarter
of an inch thick, that, on examination by the microscope,
proves to be filled with millions and millions of these exquisitely
beautiful siliceous organisms. Every submerged
stone, twig, and spear of grass, is enveloped by them; and
the waving plume-like appearance of a filamentous body
covered in this manner, is often extremely elegant. Alcohol
completely dissolves the endochrome (<i>soft colouring matter</i>)
of this species, and the frustules are left as colourless as

types, we proceed to the investigation of the fossil remains
of this tribe of Alg&aelig;.</p>

<p>In peat-bogs and swamps, both of modern and ancient
date, masses of a white marly or siliceous paste (<i>hydrate of
silica</i>), are often observed, and these are found upon microscopical
observation to be wholly made up of the frustules
of <i>Navicul&aelig;</i>, <i>Bacillari&aelig;</i>, <i>Galionell&aelig;</i>, &amp;c., with an intermixture
of the needle-like spicules of fresh-water sponges.
Many of the peat-bogs of Ireland contain layers of a white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"> 94 </a></span>
earthy substance, which, when dry, is of the appearance
and consistence of friable chalk, and entirely consists of the
siliceous cases of various kinds of diatomace&aelig;.</p>

describes a bed of this kind near the base of the
Mourne Mountains, in the County of Down, Ireland. It
consists of a very light white substance, resembling in
appearance carbonate of magnesia: it has a coarse and
somewhat fibrous fracture, and is easily reduced to powder.
It is almost entirely siliceous, and is composed of the cases
of diatomace&aelig; of the usual fresh-water species, without any
admixture of inorganic matter.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>On the banks of the river Bann, in the same county,
there is an extensive stratum of a similar earth, and which,
from being in much request for polishing plate, is locally
known as Lord Roden's plate powder. This earth is wholly
made up of the siliceous frustules of many kinds of this tribe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"> 95 </a></span>
of Alg&aelig;, and a few grains under the microscope yield a
great variety of exquisite forms: figures of several are
given in <a href="#lign_4"><i>Lign.</i> 4</a>, from specimens of this earth, with which
I was favoured by the Countess of Caledon. They comprise
two or three species of Navicula, Galionella, Coscinodiscus,

spicules or spines of fresh-water sponges.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>Beds of siliceous marl&mdash;that is, of argillaceous earth
combined with a large amount of minute particles of
silex, all of which prove to be organisms when examined
by a high magnifying power,&mdash;have been found in numerous
places not only in England, but all over the world,
since M. Ehrenberg first directed attention to their nature
and origin.</p>

<p>Near Bryansford (Newcastle), Binstwick in Holderness,
and in the Fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, extensive
fresh-water microphytal deposits have been discovered
and examined.</p>

<p>From our Antipodes I have received many examples of
these vegetable earths. My eldest son, Mr. Walter Mantell,
discovered an extensive bed of white marl on the banks of
the great brackish-water lake of Waihora, in the middle
island of New Zealand, consisting entirely of frustules of
Bacillari&aelig;. From New Plymouth he obtained some new
and exquisite forms of Navicula, Stauroneis, &amp;c.; ranges
of low hillocks of sand, of considerable extent, being made
up of microphytes (<i>microscopic plants</i>).<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>In America, recent beds of this kind of great extent
have been observed and examined by that distinguished
microscopist, Dr. Bailey, Professor of Chemistry in the Military
Academy at West Point: and the pages of that excellent
scientific periodical, Silliman's <i>American Journal of
Science</i>, are enriched with figures and descriptions of the
microphytes of which they are mainly composed.</p>

<p>But the Tertiary formations contain strata of this nature,
which far surpass in the abundance and variety of their
organic contents, any of the modern deposits we have
noticed. The <i>Polierschiefer</i>, or <i>polishing-slate</i> of Bilin, is
stated, by M. Ehrenberg,
to form a series of strata
fourteen feet in thickness,
entirely made up of the
siliceous shells of <i>Galionell&aelig;</i>, of such extreme
minuteness, that a cubic
inch of the stone contains
forty-one thousand millions. The <i>Berghmehl</i> (<i>mountain-meal</i>, or <i>fossil farina</i>),
of San Flora, in Tuscany, is one mass of these organisms.</p>

<p>In Lapland a similar earth is met with, which, in times of
scarcity, is mixed by the inhabitants with the ground bark
of trees, for food; some of this earth was found to contain
twenty different species of alg&aelig;.</p>

<p>In the district of Soos, near Egra, in Bohemia, a fine
white infusorial earth occurs, about three feet beneath the
surface; this substance, when dried, appears to the naked
eve like pure magnesia, but under the microscope is seen
to be mainly constituted of elegant disciform cases of a

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Diatomace&aelig; of the
Richmond-earth; Virginia.</span>&mdash;The town of Richmond, in Virginia,
is built on strata of siliceous marl of great extent, which earth; highly magnified.
have a total thickness, beneath
and around the town, of more than twenty feet. These
marls, whose organic composition was first detected by
Professor W. B. Rogers, are referred by that eminent
American geologist, to the older tertiary (<i>eocene</i>, or <i>miocene</i>)
formations. They occupy considerable districts, spreading
out into sterile tracts along the flanks of the hills, their siliceous
character rendering them unfavourable to vegetation.
The investigations of Dr. Bailey have shown that the frustules
so abundant in this earth, consist of several species
of Navicula (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1, fig. 1, 1a.</i></a>), Galionella (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1. fig. 3,
3a</i>.</a>), <i>Actinocyclus</i> (<a href="#lign_1"><i>Lign. 1, figs. 4, 5</i></a>), &amp;c.</p>

<p>The most remarkable forms are disciform frustules, having
their surfaces elaborately ornamented with hexagonal spots
disposed in curves, and bearing some resemblance to the
engine-turned case of a watch. <a href="#lign_7"><i>Lign. 7, fig. 2</i></a>, is a small

vary in size from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> of an inch in diameter; they

<p>When a few grains of the marl are prepared, and mounted
on a glass, almost all these varieties will be manifest, so
largely is this earth composed of organic structures; in fact,
very few inorganic particles are intermixed, the merest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"> 99 </a></span>
pellicle left by the evaporation of a drop of water in which
some of the marl has been mixed, teeming with the most
beautiful structures.</p>

<p>At Petersburg, in Virginia, a sandy marl occurs, interstratified
with deposits which, from their shells, are referred
to the older tertiary formations. Probably this marl is a
continuation of that of Richmond, but it is full of many new
forms, associated with those common in the earth of the
latter locality.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_70" id="Footnote_70"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> Dr. Bailey, with great liberality, has so amply supplied myself
and other observers with specimens of these deposits for examination,
that the fossils above described are familiar to all British microscopists.
Figures of many of those organisms are given in the American
Journal of Science.</p></div>

<p>It is an interesting fact, (first observed by Mr. Hamlin
Lee,) that the common Scallop (<i>Pecten maximus</i>), as well as
the Barnacle (<i>Balanus</i>), feed on diatomace&aelig;, and their
stomachs generally contain numerous cases of Coscinodisci,
Dichtyochi, Actinocycli, &amp;c.: a slide prepared and mounted
with the contents of the stomachs of these mollusks, presents
an assemblage of forms identical with those found in the
tertiary earths of Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In the mud of the quicksands on the shore at Brighton,
Mr. Reginald Mantell found recent Coscinodisci, &amp;c. associated
with fossil polythalamia that had been washed out of
the chalk, and precipitated with the frustules of the recent
diatomace&aelig;, into the sediments now in progress.</p>

<p>The prevalence of marine and fresh-water forms in the
same deposit is not unusual; and the remarks of Dr. Bailey
on this fact are so pertinent, that I insert them, as a
salutary caution against hasty generalizations on subjects
connected with these investigations. After describing a
species of Galionella (<i>G. moniliformis</i>), as an inhabitant only
of salt and brackish water, and stating that he had also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"> 100 </a></span>
found it sixty miles up the Hudson River, near West Point,
Dr. Bailey observes&mdash;"The Fauna and Flora of the Hudson
at this place would, if in a fossil state, be rather puzzling to
the geologist, on account of the singular mixture of marine
and fluviatile species. While <i>Valisneria</i> and <i>Potamogeton</i>
(two common fresh-water plants), grow in such vast quantities,
in some places, as to prevent the passage of a boat, and
the shore is strewn with fluviatile shells (such as Planorbis,
Physa, &amp;c.) in a living state, yet the above plants are entangled
with Alg&aelig; (sea-weeds), and marine parasitic zoophytes;
while the rocks below low-water mark are covered with
Balani (<i>barnacles</i>) and minute corallines, and the marine
Flora is represented by vast quantities of very elegant sea
plants."<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

part invisible to the unassisted eye as individual forms, constitute
by their inconceivable multitudes an important
element in the formation of sedimentary deposits. The
fact of their having been formerly treated of as animalcules,
and generally regarded as belonging to the animal

come under the notice of the
collector, that, although but
extremely few, if any, of these
objects contain organic remains,
the arborescent substances
they inclose being
merely metallic oxides, a few
remarks on their nature may
be expected. The late Dr.
Macculloch paid considerable
attention to the investigation
of these bodies, and believed
that some of the objects imbedded
in the pure and compact
quartz were really of vegetable
or animal origin; the
specimen figured <a href="#lign_11"><i>Lign. 11</i></a> is
of this kind; the fossils being
apparently cellular cryptogamous
plants. In <i>Geol.

are figured and described
by the same sagacious observer.
Mr. Bowerbank is
of opinion that spongeous structure enters into the composition
of almost all the moss-agates, and I have no doubt that
in some instances such organisms are present: but in by far
the greater number of agates and mocha-stones the inclosed
bodies are mere crystallizations; they are arborescent or
dendritical oxides of manganese, copper, chlorite, iron, &amp;c.</p>

<p>M. Brongniart, who carefully examined a great number
of agates and pebbles, with the view of determining if vegetable
substances were ever imbedded in them, could not
detect a single instance in which the
apparent mosses, conferv&aelig;, or alg&aelig;,
were organic; in every case the
mineral origin of the pseudo-vegetation
was, in his opinion, unequivocal.
Some of the beautiful green arborescent

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"> 106 </a></span>
fine specimens have been collected, especially from the vicinity
of Whitby. In the sandstone of the Inferior Oolite of the
Cleveland Hills, Yorkshire, numerous stems of this colossal
marestail have been observed standing erect, as if occupying
the position in which they grew; the same fact was also
discovered at Carlton Bank, near Stokesly, forty miles from
the coast. In both localities fossil shells of fresh-water mussels
(<i>Uniones</i>) were associated with the vegetable remains.</p>

<p>This plant is a true equisetum,
differing chiefly from
existing species in its gigantic
size and arborescent character.
The sheaths surrounding
the stem, and the
verticillate linear leaves, are
preserved in some examples:
and in all, the furrows left
by the imprints of the sheaths
are more or less strongly
impressed. The stem is not
channelled throughout, as in
<i>Calamites</i>, the carboniferous
plant whose stems at first sight might be mistaken for those
of Equisetites, but which are entirely distinct, as will be
explained hereafter. The Equisetites columnaris is peculiar
to the Oolite; it does not occur in the coal-measures.
Specimens have been discovered which indicate a height
of twenty feet, and a diameter of several inches.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

furrowed longitudinally, the articulations naked, or studded
with tubercles.</p>

<p>The plants of this genus were supposed to be related to
the marestail, but to differ in the absence of the encircling
sheaths, and in being uniformly striated; but an examination
of specimens in a better state of preservation than
those previously known, shows their affinity to the gymnosperms.
Some of the species are of a gigantic size, being
from one to three feet in diameter, and from thirty to
forty feet in height. Calamites abound in the coal formation,
and must have constituted an important feature in
the forests of the carboniferous period; they occur also
in more ancient deposits, and some species belong to the
earliest terrestrial Flora of which any vestiges are known.
In most instances when specimens are found lying in the
same plane with the strata,
they are pressed flat, but those
occurring in a vertical position
retain their natural cylindrical
form. An outer crust or
cylinder of coal generally invests
the stem, but traces of the
internal structure are rarely
preserved.</p>

<p>The Calamite consists of a
large central column of tissue,
surrounded by a ligneous cylinder.
The central part has in
most instances perished after
the death of the plant, and the
cavity thus left been filled up
with mineral matter. As the
hollow ligneous zone is almost
always carbonized, and very friable, it is seldom attached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"> 108 </a></span>
to the cast, and consequently the surface of the latter is
generally jointed and ribbed.</p>

<p>The true external surface of the cortical investment is
marked with longitudinal stri&aelig;, without any indications
of joints or constrictions; but the position of the original
articulations is indicated in some specimens by the <i>presence
of small verticillate scars, to which leaves were appended</i><a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> as

<p>We now arrive at the consideration of one of the most
interesting families of the vascular cryptogamia that
adorned the Flora of the ancient world, and the living
species of which impart beauty and elegance to the scenery
of the countries where they prevail. The most essential
character of these vegetables, is that of developing their
fructification on the leaves; a fact familiar to every one
who has even but cursorily examined the Polypody growing
on our walls, or the Brake of our hedge-rows and
commons. The largest species of British ferns scarcely
exceed four or five feet in height; but the arborescent or
tree-ferns, of warm climates, attain an altitude of from
thirty to forty feet. There is too this peculiarity in the
arborescent forms, that while in our indigenous species the
leaves surround the stem, and incline towards the upper
part of the plant, the foliage of the former bends downwards,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"> 110 </a></span>
and spreads out from the crown, or summit, into an elegant
canopy.</p>

<p>The leaves of our branched ferns are persistent, and when
shed, the markings left by their attachment to the stalk are
soon obliterated. In the arborescent ferns, on the contrary,
the petioles become detached from their bases, and fall
entire, leaving scars or cicatrices on the stem; and these
impressions are so regularly and symmetrically disposed,
as to afford characters by which the trunks may be distinguished
from those of other trees. The stems of the
tree-ferns are therefore easily recognized in a fossil state
externally, by their cylindrical forms without ramification,
and by the regular disposition and peculiar character of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"> 111 </a></span>
scars left by the separation of the petioles; and, internally
by that peculiar zone, formed of bundles of ligneous tissue
inclosed in sheaths, which encircles the central axis, as
shown in the transverse sections in <a href="#lign_2"><i>Lign.</i> 2</a>, <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_62">p. 62</a>. The
leaves may be identified by the form of their segments,
which are disposed with remarkable regularity, and have a
peculiar mode of subdivision; and above all, by the delicacy,
evenness, and distribution of the veins. There are upwards
of two thousand species of living ferns, and in the fossil
kingdom the number is considerable; more than two hundred
have been collected from the carboniferous formation.
The recent tree-ferns are confined almost exclusively to the
equinoctial regions; humidity and heat being the conditions
most favourable to their development (<i>V&eacute;g. Foss.</i> p. 141.
<i>Bd.</i> p. 461. <i>Wond.</i> p. 727).</p>

<p>From the elegance and diversity of form of their foliage,
fossil ferns are the most remarkable and attractive vegetable
remains in the ancient strata. The greater number are from
the coal deposits, the fern-leaves generally occurring in the
schists or shales that form the roof of the beds of coal.
Many of the strata are made up of carbonized fern-leaves
and stems closely pressed together. The roof of a coal-mine,
when newly exposed, often presents a most interesting
appearance, from the abundance and variety of leaves,
branches, and stems, that occur either in relief, or impressed
on the dark glossy surface. The specimens selected for
illustration exhibit the principal modes of venation on which
the genera are founded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The fossil genera have been established by M. Ad. Brongniart,
from the form of the leaves and the characters of their
venation; that is, the distribution of the vessels. In the
following descriptions some botanical phrases are necessarily
employed; a few terms of frequent occurrence are explained

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> Hoer is a little village, situated nearly in the centre of Scania, a
province in the southern extremity of Sweden. The Chalk formation
appears in several parts of this district, and Carboniferous
strata at Hoeganes. To the west of Hoer, there is a range of hills,
composed of ferruginous grits, micaceous sandstones, clays, and beds
of quartzose conglomerate. It is in these strata that the ferns and
other terrestrial plants occur, and no animal remains whatever
have been found in them; their geological position appears to be
between the Chalk and the Coal, but on this point nothing positive
is known. The general analogy of the plants with the group forming
the Flora of the Wealden, led M. Brongniart to suppose that the deposits
in question belong to that formation; and M. Nillson, of Lund,
who examined my collection at Brighton, recognized, among some undescribed
plants from Tilgate Forest, forms that he had collected from
Hoer. See "<i>Observations sur les V&eacute;g&eacute;taux Fossiles renferm&eacute;s dans les
Gr&egrave;s de Hoer en Scanie: par M. Ad. Brongniart.</i>" <i>Ann. Sc. Nat.</i> 1825.</p></div>


<p>Many other genera of fossil ferns have been established

in <i>Brit. Foss. Flor.</i>, and other British and foreign works.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Stems of arborescent Ferns.</span>&mdash;Notwithstanding the
profusion with which the foliage of many kinds of ferns is
distributed throughout the coal formation, the undoubted
stems of plants of this family are rarely met with; for the
numerous tribe called Sigillari&aelig; is now removed altogether
from this class. It may, however, admit of question whether
much of the foliage which, from the analogy of structure,
has been referred to ferns, may not have belonged to those
trees; for as in the animal kingdom, so in the vegetable,
distinct types of living organisms are often found blended
in the lost races; and as the stems of recent tree-ferns are
even more durable than their leaves, it seems impossible to
account for their absence in strata, that inclose entire layers
of the foliage matted together. A few fossils, supposed to
possess the essential characters of recent fern-stems, have
been discovered, and arranged under the following genus.</p>

Red sandstone, near Hillersdorf,
in the neighbourhood
of Chemnitz, in Saxony, silicified stems, apparently of tree-ferns,
occur in great numbers. They are remarkably beautiful,
and the organization of the original is so well preserved by
the silex, that slices, examined by the microscope, display
the peculiar structure almost as perfectly as if the plants were
recent: transverse sections exhibit the arched bundles of
vascular fibres which compose the ligneous cylinder, surrounded
by the cellular tissue. From the stellated markings
produced by sections of the vessels that compose the tissues,
and which are visible to the naked eye, these fossils have
obtained the popular name of <i>Staaren-stein</i>, or Star-stone.
The external surface of the specimens I have examined has
a ligneous structure, and is of a dark reddish brown colour;
internally the stems are of a dull red, mottled with various

perusal of the ingenious but unsuccessful attempt of the excellent
author, Mr. Parkinson, to elucidate their nature. I have still a specimen
which he presented to me more than thirty-five years since,
as one of the most curious and perplexing fossils that had ever come
under his notice.</p></div>

<p>An excellent work ("<i>Dendrolithen</i>") on these fossils, in
which thirty species are described, has been published at
Dresden by M. Cotta; who arranges them under the genus
<i>Psaronius</i> or <i>Psarolites</i>. The stem is composed of two
distinct parts; an outer zone, consisting of a great number
of nearly cylindrical bundles of vessels, supposed to have
been roots which proceeded from the stem near its base; and
an inner part or axis. In the outer portion, the fossil <i>air-roots</i>
have a vascular tissue, but there is often a delicate
cellular tissue interposed. In the axis the vessels form zigzag
or wavy bands, resembling those of ferns.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> These flexuous
and vermiform bands are entirely composed of barred or
scalariform vessels, similar to those of ferns and club-mosses.
The Psarolites are therefore considered by M. Ad. Brongniart
to be the bases of the trunks of lycopodiaceous trees,
while M. Cotta and other botanists regard them as true
arborescent ferns.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>Among the most common and striking objects that arrest
the attention of a person who visits a coal-mine for the first
time, and examines the numerous vegetable relics that are
profusely dispersed among the heaps of slate, coal, and shale,
are long flat slabs, from half an inch to an inch thick, having
both surfaces longitudinally fluted, and uniformly pitted
with deep symmetrical imprints; these are disposed with
such perfect regularity between the grooves, that the specimens
are often supposed, by persons not conversant with
pal&aelig;ontology, to be engraven stones, and not natural productions.
These fossils are the flattened trunks of gigantic
trees covered by the bark in the state of coal; the regular imprints
on the surface, being the scars left by the separation
of the petioles or leaf-stalks, as in the arborescent ferns previously
examined. The name <i>Sigillaria</i>, commonly applied
to these fossils, is derived from <i>sigillum</i>, a seal, and alludes
to the regular and uniform pattern of the imprints on the
surface. These stems are from a few inches to several feet
in diameter, and the largest attain a height of sixty feet;
they are generally found lying in a horizontal position in
the strata, and quite flat, from the pressure produced by the
superincumbent rocks; but when the trunks are in an erect
position, and at right angles to the plane of the beds, the
cylindrical form of the original is preserved.</p>

<p>A remarkable instance, in which five stems of Sigillaria
were standing upright, with their roots in the soil below,
apparently in the position in which they grew, was brought
to light a few years since, in forming the Bolton and Manchester
railway.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> They stand on the same plane, and near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"> 126 </a></span>
to each other. Their roots are branched, and spread out in
the bed of impure coal in which they are implanted. The
trunks are surrounded by a soft blue shale. The largest tree
is eleven feet high, and seven and a half feet in circumference
at the base; its trunk is gnarled and knotted, and
has many decorticated prominences, like those in barked
timber of our old dicotyledonous trees; the roots, too, partake
of the same character.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The others are respectively
from three to five feet in height. A sketch of one of the
short stems is subjoined. All the trees were broken off as

carbonized bark. All the stems were filled with blue clay,
or shale, a proof that they were hollow when submerged in
the mud, which is now consolidated into the shale in which
they are imbedded. But it is not probable that they were
originally tubular, like a reed: on the contrary, there is
evidence to show that they were highly organized. Their
internal structure may have decayed, or been destroyed by
insects or other depredators; as is often the case in tropical
climates, where the trunks of timber trees are speedily
excavated after their fall, and afford shelter to innumerable
insects and reptiles, as the weary traveller often finds to his

<p>Many other instances have been noticed of Sigillari&aelig;
standing more or less erect in the strata. In forming the
railway tunnel at Claycross, five miles south of Chesterfield,
through the middle portion of the Derbyshire coal-measures,
in 1838, a group of nearly forty trees (<i>Sigillari&aelig;</i>) was discovered,
standing not more than three or four feet apart, at
right angles to the plane of the strata.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> On the coast of
Northumberland, within the length of half a mile, twenty

The coal-pit at St. Etienne, in France, described by M. Alex.
Brongniart, is celebrated for affording an example of this
phenomenon (<i>Wond.</i> p. 673); but the positions of many of
those stems are inclined at various angles, and their roots
implanted in different beds, so that the perpendicularity of
the erect trees is probably accidental (<i>Bd.</i> p. 471).</p>

<p>The stems of Sigillari&aelig; vary in size from a few inches to
five feet in diameter; and in length from five to sixty feet;
they gradually taper from the base to the summit. A specimen
measured by M. Brongniart was forty feet long, one
foot in diameter at the base, and but six inches at the top,
where it divided into two equal branches. These stems
may be readily distinguished from those of other trees with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"> 129 </a></span>
which they are associated, by the fluted surface produced
by the deep longitudinal grooves, and the regularly disposed
imprints between the channels.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> The carbonized bark,
in large specimens, is often an inch thick, but in small

flakes off with the slightest touch, leaving the inner surface
exposed, with the coal remaining in the deep furrows
and pits, as in <a href="#lign_33"><i>Lign. 33, fig. 1</i></a>. No traces of leaves, or fruit,

observe, that when mineral matter has permeated the stems
of plants, the vascular tissue is often so well preserved, that
one such specimen affords more important information, than
hundreds of examples in which the form alone remains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SIGILLARLA ELEGANS.</div>

<p>The external surface of this specimen possesses the characteristic
markings of the insertion of the leaf-stalks of
<i>Sigillaria elegans</i>. The internal organization, as seen in
the transverse section, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The centre, filled with silex; it exhibits no traces of
structure.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> The zone which surrounds the interspace on which this
letter is placed, is composed of bundles of vascular tissue.
A portion of one of these bundles, highly magnified, is represented
in <i>Plate V. fig. 7</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>inner</i> circle of this zone, indicated by the <i>convex undulating
line</i>, is made up of medullary vascular tissue; the
external circle is divided by rays, and is composed of woody
fibre, constituting a ligneous cylinder. One of the spiral
vessels (<i>fig. 3</i>), and another showing a remarkable difference
of structure in a short space (<i>fig.</i> 2), as seen in a longitudinal
section of the medullary tissue, are figured in
<a href="#lign_35"><i>Lign.</i> 35.</a></p>

<p>The ligneous cylinder is surrounded by a band of cellular
tissue, and the space between this and the cortical integument
is occupied by silex, in which there are but obscure
traces of structure.</p>

<p>The inner layer of bark, <i>f</i>, is composed of elongated cells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"> 132 </a></span>
disposed in a radiating manner, and traversed by fibro-vascular
bundles, which pass towards the leaves.</p>

<p>Upon instituting a comparison between the fossil and the
stems of those recent plants which present the closest
analogy to it, M. Brongniart was led to conclude that the
Sigillari&aelig; constituted a peculiar extinct family, belonging to
the great division of gymnospermous dicotyledons.</p>

<p>The Sigillari&aelig; were tall erect trees, with a regular and
cylindrical stem, without side branches, but dichotomous
towards the summit. Their superficial bark was hard and
durable, channelled longitudinally, bearing leaf-scars that
are of a rounded form above and below, and angular at
the sides, often oblong in relation to the stem, and having
three vascular pits, one central and small, and two lateral of
a larger size. The internal structure bears most analogy to
that of the Cycade&aelig;, and the foliage consisted of long linear
carinated leaves. The Sigillari&aelig;, therefore, differ essentially
from the arborescent cryptogamia, which they somewhat
approach in having scalariform vascular tissue, symmetrical
and regular leaf-scars, and branchless trunks. More than
fifty species have been determined.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">STIGMARIA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Stigmaria.</span> <i>Lign. 36.</i>&mdash;This extended notice of the
structure of the Sigillari&aelig;,.will enable us to understand the
nature of the fossil vegetables termed Stigmari&aelig;, or spotted-stems,
which abound in the beds of under-clay of most coal-fields,
as stated in a former part of this work (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>.).
These bodies when uncompressed are of a cylindrical form,
from one to six or seven inches in diameter, and of considerable
length&mdash;sometimes upwards of twenty feet&mdash;and gradually
diminish in size towards their termination. The surface
is marked with distinct pits or areol&aelig;, of a circular or oval
form, with a small tubercle in the centre of each, disposed
around the stem in a quincunx and somewhat regular order.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"> 133 </a></span>
When broken transversely, a small cylindrical axis is seen
to extend in a longitudinal direction through the stem, like
a medullary column; it seldom occupies the centre, but lies
near to one side, and parallel with a depression on the outer
surface of the fossil. This internal body is often loose, and
removable; its surface is covered with interrupted, irregular,
longitudinal, ridges, which leave corresponding depressions
on the walls of the cavity in which it was inclosed. <a href="#lign_36"><i>Lign.</i> 36</a>,

<p>When Stigmari&aelig; are observed in the under-clay, to which
stratum they are principally confined, long, tapering, subcylindrical
fibres, often several feet in length, are seen
affixed to the tubercles with which the surface is covered;
their form and mode of attachment are shown in <a href="#lign_36"><i>Lign.</i> 36</a>.
Instances occur in which several Stigmari&aelig; spring from a
common centre, of a dome-like form, whence they radiate
in every direction (<i>Bd.</i> pl. lvi. <i>fig.</i> 8), and the main branches
divide and subdivide till they are lost in the surrounding
rock.</p>

<p>The nature of these fossil vegetables was long a perplexing
question, for no specimens had been found in connexion with
any of the stems, branches, or foliage, that abound in the
coal deposits. At length, the discovery of a dome-shaped
mass, to which were attached numerous Stigmari&aelig;, seemed
to afford a clue to the solution of this botanical problem;
and it was concluded by the eminent authors of the "Fossil
Flora of Great Britain," that the original belonged to a tribe
of plants which inhabited swamps, or still and shallow lakes,
and were characterized by a low truncated stem, having
long horizontal branches beset with cylindrical, and, probably,
succulent leaves, that either trailed on the surface of
the swamp, or floated in the water.</p>

<p>But within the last few years, the occurrence in various
carboniferous deposits of erect stems of Sigillari&aelig;, has shown
that the Stigmari&aelig; are nothing more than the roots of these
and other congenerous trees; an opinion maintained by the
Rev. H. Steinhaur more than thirty years ago, and subsequently
affirmed by M. Adolphe Brongniart, who found, on
examining microscopically the internal structure of a silicified
specimen in which the vascular tissue was preserved,
that it bore as close an analogy to that of the Sigillari&aelig;, as
exists between the roots and trunks of certain dicotyledonous
trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"> 135 </a></span></p>

<p>The annexed figure, <a href="#lign_37"><i>Lign.</i> 37</a>, represents the transverse
section of a small Stigmaria, with the axis displaced from
its natural situation; this circumstance, as well as the corresponding
external groove, has arisen from compression, by
which the tough cylinder has been forced from its original
position in the middle of the soft cellular tissue, to one
side.</p>

This specimen shows that the cylinder (<i>a</i> in <a href="#lign_36"><i>Lign.</i> 36</a>) is formed of bundles

</div>

<p>The central axis is thus shown to be a cylinder composed
of bundles of vessels, disposed in a radiating manner, and
separated from each other by medullary rays; the whole
constituting a ligneous zone resembling that of Sigillaria
(see <a href="#lign_35"><i>Lign.</i> 35</a>); but the inner circle of medullary tissue
seen in the latter is altogether wanting. This difference is
similar to that observable in the stems or branches of a
dicotyledonous tree, in which the woody cylinder is associated
internally with bundles of medullary tissue, and the
roots of the same tree that are destitute of them. Part of a

<p>This opinion of M. Brongniart was confirmed by the

upright trunk of a Sigillaria, nine feet high, with ten roots
eight or nine feet in length, still attached, and extending in
their natural position. <i>These roots are undoubted Stigmari&aelig;

<p>In the Pictou coal-field of Cape Breton, in Nova Scotia,
similar facts have been brought to light; the remarkable
phenomena existing in that locality, of successive carboniferous
deposits containing scores of erect trees with roots
spreading into their native soil, presenting peculiar facilities
for verifying the observations made in England. In an
interesting memoir on the coal-fields of Nova Scotia, Mr.
Richard Brown has given a detailed account of numerous
examples of stems of Sigillari&aelig;, and of Lepidodendra, (a tribe
of gigantic club-mosses of which we shall presently treat,)
with the roots attached; these roots, in every instance, had
the characters and structure of Stigmari&aelig;. In one instance,
the stem of the tree was broken off close to the roots, and
the hollow cylinder of bark was bent down and doubled
over by the pressure of the surrounding mud, so as effectually
to close up the aperture, and leave only a few irregular
cicatrices converging near the apex; this fossil
explains the true nature of the "dome-shaped" plant figured

<p>The remains of this tribe of plants abound in the coal
formation, and rival in number and magnitude the Calamites
and Sigillari&aelig; previously described. These trees have
received the name of <i>Lepidodendra</i>, from the scaly character
of their stems, occasioned by the angular scars left by the
separation of the foliage, as is the case in arborescent ferns:
the term, however, simply indicates the appearance, for
the surface is not imbricated. Some of these trees have
been found almost entire, from the roots to their topmost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"> 139 </a></span>
branches. One specimen, forty feet high, and thirteen feet
in diameter at the base, divided towards the summit into fifteen
or twenty branches, was discovered in the Jarrow coal-mine.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
The foliage consists of simple, linear leaves, spirally
arranged around the stem, and appears to have been shed
from the base of the tree with age. The scars produced by
the attachment of the petioles were persistent; and the
twigs and branches are generally found covered with foliage,
as in <a href="#lign_39"><i>Lign.</i> 39</a>. The roots are Stigmari&aelig;, like those of the
Sigillari&aelig;, as proved by specimens in the Pictou coal-field,
discovered by Mr. Brown.<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The internal organization of the stem of Lepidodendron
differs from that of Sigillaria, in the absence of the woody
cylinder and medullary rays which constitute so peculiar
and important a character in the latter. The Lepidodendra
have only an eccentric, vascular, medullary zone, the interval
between which and the bark is filled up by cellular
tissue.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> In their structure, external configuration, mode of
ramification, and disposition of the leaves, they accord so
closely with the <i>Lycopodiace&aelig;</i>, that, notwithstanding the
disparity in size, M. Brongniart, Dr. Joseph Hooker, and
other eminent botanists, concur in regarding them as gigantic
arborescent club-mosses<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> The living species of Lycopodiace&aelig;
amount to nearly two hundred, the greater number
of which, like the arborescent ferns, inhabit the islands of
intertropical regions. They are diminutive plants, with
delicate foliage, none exceeding three feet in height; most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"> 140 </a></span>
of them trail on the ground, but there are a few erect
species, one of which (<i>Lycopodium densum</i>) is abundant in
New Zealand.</p>

<p>The fruit of the Club-mosses is an oval or cylindrical cone,
which in some species is situated at the extremity of the
branches, and constitutes an imbricated spike. Now associated
with the stems of the Lepidodendra, and very often
in masses of their foliage, and in some instances attached to
the extremities of the branches, are numerous oblong, or
sub-cylindrical, scaly cones, garnished with leaves. These
have received the names of <i>Lepidostrobi</i> (scaly-cones), and
are unquestionably the fruit of the trees with which they
are imbedded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEPIDOSTROBUS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lepidostrobus.</span> <i>Lign. 40.</i>&mdash;A cylindrical strobilus or
cone, imbricated from above downwards, composed of winged
scales, terminating in rhomboidal discs: the axis traversed
by a longitudinal cavity or receptacle.</p>

<p>These fossils have long been known to collectors, and are
figured by Martin (<i>Petrif. Derbiensia</i>), Parkinson (<i>Org.
Rem.</i> vol. i. pl. ix.), and others. They are cylindrical imbricated
bodies, rounded at both extremities, from two to
six or seven inches in length, and one or two inches in circumference.
When broken asunder, a cylindrical cavity is
exposed, which is sometimes hollow, but commonly filled
with mineral matter; and when specimens are found imbedded
in shale, the cone is fringed with linear-lanceolate
bracte&aelig;, as in <a href="#lign_40"><i>Lign. 40, fig. 3</i></a>. These fruits, like the fronds
of ferns, often form the nuclei of ironstone nodules, and the
leaves are frequently replaced either by a white hydrate of
alumine, or by the mineral called galena, or sulphuret of
lead, and the receptacles filled with the same substances.
The specimens from Coalbrook Dale are generally in this
state of mineralization, and possess great brilliancy; they
are interesting examples of the electro-chemical changes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"> 141 </a></span>
which these fruits of the carboniferous forests have undergone.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_109" id="Footnote_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> These fossil cones are not liable to decompose, like the pyritous
fruits from the Isle of Sheppey; they require no preparation for the
cabinet; washing injures their lustre; a soft brush will safely remove
any extraneous matter. There is a fine collection of Lepidostrobi in
the British Museum; see Petrifactions, p. 42.</p></div>

<p><i>Triplosporite.</i>&mdash;Additional light has recently been thrown
on the structure of the Lepidostrobi, by Dr. Robert Brown's
examination of a silicified specimen of the upper part of a
strobilus, in which the internal organization is beautifully
displayed. The reader specially interested in this department
of fossil botany should refer to the original memoir
by the illustrious President of the Linn&aelig;an Society, with
the accompanying plates that admirably exhibit the microscopic
analysis of the structure of this remarkable fossil;
a slice of which was shown me some years since by the late
Marquis of Northampton.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> The external surface of the
specimen is covered with hexagonal areol&aelig;; the transverse
sections exhibit the appearance of the bracte&aelig; and sporangia.
The strobilus is formed of a central axis of relatively small
diameter, from which proceed bracte&aelig;, about thirteen in
number, that are densely approximated, and much imbricated;
and of an equal number of sporangia, filled with
innumerable microscopic sporules, originally connected in
threes. This triple composition of sporules (which differs
from the constant quadruple union in the tribes of existing
plants presumed to be most nearly allied to the fossil,
namely the <i>Ophioglosse&aelig;</i> and <i>Lycopodiace&aelig;</i>) is expressed by
the name <i>Triplosporite</i>, adopted by Dr. Brown to indicate
this peculiarity of structure, and the class or primary division
to which the original plant is supposed to belong.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><i>Halonia.</i>&mdash;The specimens usually seen are mere sandstone
casts having a thin carbonaceous crust; the stem is
branched and beset with large elevated knobs, or subcortical
protuberances, as shown in <a href="#lign_41"><i>fig. 1, Lign. 41</i></a>. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"> 145 </a></span>
plants appear to be closely related to the Lepidodendra;
their mode of branching is shown in a beautiful specimen
(in the museum of the Leeds Philos. Soc.) figured
and described by Mr. Denny, which is also remarkable
because it indicates the probability that the Haloni&aelig;, and
the fossil stems, termed Knorri&aelig;, are identical; for the
specimen in question, which in its branches is unquestionably
of the former type, has the base of the stem impressed
with the leaf-scars of the latter.</p>

<p><i>Knorria.</i>&mdash;To this genus the authors of the Fossil Flora
of Great Britain referred those stems which have projecting
leaf-scars, arranged spirally. The beautiful specimen figured
as <i>Knorria taxina</i>, <a href="#lign_41"><i>Lign. 41, fig. 2</i></a>, closely resembles a
young branch of Yew (<i>Taxus</i>), and perhaps might be more
correctly named <i>Taxites</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bothrodendron and Ulodendron.</i>&mdash;These genera, together
with <i>Megaphyton</i>, are stems of a very remarkable character,
and are easily distinguished by the vertical rows of large
and distant scars. The two first have two series of very
deep oval depressions on opposite sides of the stems, arranged
alternately in the specimens I have examined: from
the size and form of these obliquely-oval cavities, it is supposed
that they were formed by the attachment of cones,
and not by petioles; but their real nature is involved in
obscurity.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ASTEROPHYLLITES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Asterophyllites.</span>&mdash;I shall conclude this notice of some
of the most characteristic trees of the Carboniferous Flora,
with an account of a tribe of plants whose remains are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"> 146 </a></span>
common in the coal-shales and grits, that there are but few
large slabs with vegetable remains that do not exhibit examples
of the elegant verticillate foliage of one or more species.
The term <i>Asterophyllites</i>, (expressive of the star-like form of
the leaves,) applied to this family by M. Ad. Brongniart, includes
several fossil plants which are known to geologists
under different generic names; the following concise account

<p>1. <i>Calamodendron.</i>&mdash;These are arborescent stems, ligneous
internally, and covered with a smooth carbonaceous crust,
without regular longitudinal stri&aelig;, and not articulated; but
the woody axis covered by this bark is deeply striated and
articulated, resembling in this respect the true Calamites.
These stems have a large central pith, or medullary column,
surrounded by a ligneous zone, which is formed of radiated
bands, without circles of growth: the structure of the
carbonized bark is unknown.</p>

<p>2. <i>Asterophyllites.</i>&mdash;These are supposed to be the branches
and foliage of the stems above described.</p>

<p>3. <i>Sphenophyllum.</i>&mdash;Plants, differing in the form of the
leaves, but analogous in structure and mode of fructification
to the Asterophyllites.</p>

<p>4. <i>Annularia.</i>&mdash;Herbaceous aquatic plants, distinct from
the preceding.</p>

<p>5. <i>Volkmannia.</i>&mdash;These fossil plants are Asterophyllites

<p>The <i>Asterophyllites</i> (<a href="#lign_42"><i>Lign.</i> 42</a>) had branched articulated
stems, with verticillate leaves, arranged perpendicularly to
the branches which supported them: but as the foliage is in
most instances partially concealed, the natural form is but
seldom observable.</p>

<p>The original plants are supposed to have been a tribe of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"> 147 </a></span>
flowering dicotyledons, for small seed-vessels resembling
those of the Cypress are often found with the foliage.</p>

plants related to the <i>Marsiliace&aelig;</i>, or Pepper-worts. The
leaves are triangular, truncated at the summit, and very
deeply lobed and dentated. The fructification consists of
sessile axillary or terminal spikes, composed of verticillate

<p>The reader will observe that the fossil vegetables hitherto
described belong, with but few exceptions, to the Carboniferous
flora; and that the remains of Ferns, Calamites, Sigillari&aelig;,
and Lepidodendra, compose in a great measure those
prodigious accumulations of mineral fuel, or coal, which
supply the luxuries and necessities created by civilization.</p>

<p>Our review of fossil plants will now assume somewhat of
a botanical arrangement, and we proceed to notice some of
the most characteristic vegetable forms of the secondary and
tertiary formations. We commence our examination with
those remarkable tribes of gymnosperms, the Cycadace&aelig;,
which comprise the Zami&aelig; and Cycade&aelig;.</p>

<p>The plants of this subdivision of the vegetable kingdom,
from their singular structure and mode of growth, their
simple cylindrical stems, and coronets of pinnated foliage,
resembling that of certain palms, their usually gyrate vernation
like that of the ferns, and their anomalous inflorescence
and fructification, are objects of great interest to
the scientific botanist; while the abundance of their fossil
remains in the secondary formations renders them of the
highest importance to the geologist.</p>

<p>As many kinds of Zamia<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and Cycas are cultivated in our
hot-houses, the general appearance of the plants of this
order must be familiar to
the reader: the annexed
figure of a beautiful living
Cycas in the Royal Gardens
at Kew, will serve to
illustrate the general aspect
of these exotics.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_120" id="Footnote_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_120"><span class="label">[120]</span></a> The Linn&aelig;an genus Zamia is now separated into five or six
genera, as Encephalartos, Macrozamia, Dion, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The Zami&aelig; are short
plants, with stout cylindrical
stems, beset with
thick scales, which are the
bases of the petioles that
have been shed: towards
the summit the stem is
garnished with a crown of
elegant leaves; the fruit
resembles the cones of pines. The leaves are pinnated, and
very tough; their venation is either parallel as in endogens,
or dichotomous as in ferns, but never reticulated as in exogens:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"> 151 </a></span>
in a young state they are coiled up like a crosier, as
in ferns.</p>

<p>The Cycade&aelig; have the general aspect of the Zami&aelig;, but
differ in their fructification and other characters; and some
species have the stem bifurcated towards the top, and attain
a height of upwards of twenty feet; for example, <i>C. circinalis</i>.</p>

<p>The stem in its internal structure<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> bears a close analogy
to that of the Conifer&aelig;; it has a central medullary column
surrounded by a ligneous cylinder, divided by cellular
medullary rays, each composed of bundles of vessels, and
a thick cellular cortical investment or false-bark,<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> composed
of the persistent scales that formed the bases of the
petioles. (See <a href="#Plate_V"><i>Pl. V. fig. 5.</i></a>)</p>

in recent and fossil Zami&aelig; and Cycade&aelig;.</p></div>

<p>The existing species of Cycadace&aelig; are exclusively natives
of hot regions, and chiefly inhabit the West Indies, South
Africa, Equinoctial America, Japan, New Holland, &amp;c.;
not one species is known in Europe: a fact in striking contrast
with the abundance of fossil plants of this order, which
occur throughout the secondary formations of England and
the continent.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

near London, is that of <span class="smcap">James Yates</span>, Esq., of Lauderdale House,
Highgate; it comprises choice examples of several of the sub-genera
into which these plants are now divided by botanists.</p></div>

<p>No true cycads have hitherto been discovered in the carboniferous
deposits; it is in the floras of the secondary
epochs, from the new Red to the Cretaceous inclusive, that
this tribe of plants forms an important feature. The foliage,
stems, and fruits, occur in a fossil state; and as these organs
cannot be referred with certainty to their respective plants,
distinct genera are formed for their reception.</p>

<p><i>Foliage.</i>&mdash;From the tough and durable nature of the
leaves, the foliage of the Cycade&aelig; occurs in a fine state of

preservation; and in the fluvio-marine deposits of the Oolite
of Yorkshire, many specimens of great beauty have been
collected. I know not another locality in England so rich
in fossils of this kind, as the cliffs along the coast near
Scarborough; Gristhorpe Bay is well known to collectors.
Not only the leaves, but also the fruits or cones occur, and
of these, examples are to be seen in most public museums.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>

<p>The leaflet of the recent Cycas is distinguished
by a strong nervure, which
runs along the middle; that of Zamia
has no midrib, but fine parallel veins
that pass direct to the margin.</p>

the surface of the fruit is concealed by the elongated

of Portland were first described botanically by Dr. Buckland,
(Geol. Trans, vol. ii. 2d Series,) under the name of <i>Cycadeoidea</i>;
of which Memoir the account in <i>Bd.</i> p. 404, is an
abstract. M. Ad. Brongniart, considering these plants as a
peculiar type, referred them to a new genus, which he did me
the honour to name <i>Mantellia</i> (<i>Prod. Veg. Foss.</i>). These stems
or trunks are from one to two feet in height; the circumference
of the largest not exceeding three feet. The stem is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"> 158 </a></span>
subcylindrical, and the external surface covered with the
rhomboidal scars formed by the attachment of the leaf-stalks,
and which are widest in their transverse diameter.</p>

<p>There are two species, which are readily distinguished by
the form of the stems, and the difference in the size of the
cicatrices left by the petioles.</p>

<p>The most common kind is short, and spheroidal, and
the leaf-scars are relatively large; its shape has caused it
to be named "<i>Crows' nest</i>," by the quarrymen, who believe
these plants to be nests that were built by crows in the
trees of the petrified forest with which they are imbedded.
The specific name (<i>nidiformis</i>) adopted by M. Brongniart,
expresses this popular notion.</p>

<p><i>Lign. 50.</i> represents a fine example from the Portland
Dirt-bed, which exhibits a structure altogether similar to that
which characterizes the stems of recent cycadeous plants;
namely, (<i>a</i>) a central mass of cellular tissue surrounded
by circles of laminated ligneous rays or plates (<i>b</i>); then a
zone of cellular tissue (<i>c</i>), and an external cylinder of false-bark
(<i>d</i>). The mode of increase by buds, from germs in
the axill&aelig; of the petioles, as in
the living plants, is also distinctly
seen.</p>

<p>The other species is subcylindrical,
and the leaf-scars are much
smaller and more regular than in
<i>M. nidiformis</i>, indicating a more
delicate foliage, as expressed by
Buckland's specific name: that
of M. Brongniart refers to the
cylindrical form of the stem. This
plant was higher and more slender
than its associate. Numerous buds are seen in the axill&aelig; of

<p>From the imperfect state of the
remains of these plants, the structure
and affinities of the originals were very
ambiguous, and the fossils have been
placed by some eminent botanists with
the Liliace&aelig;, and by others with the
Asphodele&aelig;; their true botanical position
is doubtless with the Cycadace&aelig;; for in some points
they resemble the Zami&aelig;, in others the Cycade&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"> 160 </a></span></p>

<p>The stem of the Clathraria is composed of a solid internal
axis, the surface of which is covered with reticulated fibres;
the large branched specimen of this
part, figured in <a href="#lign_52"><i>Lign. 52</i></a>, is the finest
example hitherto obtained: it was discovered,
with bones of the Iguanodon,
in a quarry near Cuckfield, Sussex, in
1820. The axis is invested with a very
thick false-bark, formed of the consolidated
bases of the leaf-stalks, the insertions
of which are rhomboidal and
transverse. The outer surface of the
bark is consequently marked with elevated
lozenge-shaped cicatrices (<a href="#lign_53"><i>Lign. 53</i></a>),
separated from each other by a
marginal furrow, which is surrounded
by a parallel ridge or band of a fibrous
structure.</p>

<p>I have spared neither trouble nor expense in endeavouring
to detect the organization of this plant; numerous
sections of stems have been cut, and examined
microscopically, but very few exhibit
any traces of structure; and in those
which retain some vestiges of organization,
the siliceous mass which permeates the
vascular tissue, is not sufficiently transparent
to yield satisfactory results. It can
only be inferred that in their internal organization,
as in their external characters,
the Clathrari&aelig; were most nearly allied
to the Cycade&aelig; or Zami&aelig;. A remarkable
specimen, (<a href="#lign_56"><i>Lign. 56</i></a>,) discovered in a stratum
of Chalk-marl, near Bonchurch, confirms
this view, and throws much light
on the nature and relations of these vegetables.</p>

<p>This fossil is a portion of the summit of a stem garnished
with persistent petioles, or leaf-stalks; it is fifteen
inches in length, and nearly perfect
at the top; and at the
lower end, which has been broken
off transversely, the inner
axis (<a href="#lign_56"><i>Lign. 56 a</i>.</a>), surrounded
by the false-bark formed by the
confluence and consolidation of
the bases of the petioles, is exposed.
The stem has been stript
of the leaf-stalks at the lowermost
part, and exhibits the characteristic
lattice-like scars. The
petioles are for the most part entire; some of them are abortive,
and others, which have supported leaves, are marked
on the summits with vascular pits, indicating that the foliage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"> 162 </a></span>
was shed naturally; as shown in <a href="#lign_55"><i>Lign. 55 a</i></a>. These petioles
were probably persistent for some years, as in the existing
Cycads. The opposite side of the stem to that represented
is covered with elongated and flattened petioles.</p>

<p>On the sea-shore bounded by cliffs of Wealden rocks,
in the Isle of Wight, water-worn portions of stems of Clathrari&aelig;
are occasionally met with; and these are impressed
with the lozenge-shaped areas left by the petioles, as in the
specimen, <a href="#lign_57"><i>Lign. 57</i></a>. Mr. Saxby, of Bonchurch, has favoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"> 163 </a></span>
me with the loan of a thin section of a stem of Clathraria
in which the bundles of vascular
tissue in the petioles
appear to be made up of
spiral vessels. From what
has been advanced, it is obvious
that these remarkable
plants of the Wealden flora
were gymnosperms, closely
related to the Cycade&aelig;.</p>

<p>Vestiges of roots, seed-vessels,
and panicles, have
been found in the Wealden,
which may possibly belong
to the Clathraria; but the
evidence as to their presumed
relationship is at present too vague to require further
notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Endogenites erosa.</span>&mdash;(<i>Geol S. E.</i> pl. i.; Tilg. Foss. pl.
iii.; and by Dr. Fitton in <i>Geol. Trans.</i> vol. iv.)&mdash;The genus
<i>Endogenites</i> was established by M. Ad. Brongniart for the
reception of those fossil stems and woods, whose internal
structure is endogenous, but which are too imperfect to be
referred to any particular family. In this category must
be placed certain silicified stems having a carbonaceous
cortical investment, which I discovered in the strata of
Tilgate Forest, in 1820.</p>

<p>These fossils often occur in the layers of lignite which traverse
the clay-beds in some parts of the Weald of Sussex.
They are from one to eight inches in diameter, and five or six
feet in length, and of very irregular shapes; I have not observed
any indications of branches. Some specimens are subcylindrical
in the middle, and gradually taper to a point at
each end; others are of a depressed clavated form, like some
of the Cacte&aelig; or Euphorbiace&aelig;. They are generally silicified,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"> 164 </a></span>
and, when <i>in situ</i>, are invested with a friable carbonaceous
crust, of a glossy lustre, which soon falls to pieces on
exposure to the atmosphere, so that cabinet specimens
seldom retain any vestiges of it. When this coaly matter
is removed, the surface of the silicified stem is seen to be
traversed by numerous fine meandering grooves, and deep,
tortuous channels, disposed in an irregular manner, in a
longitudinal direction. These channels or vessels, which
are generally lined with quartz crystals, give the surface
that eroded appearance which suggested the specific name,
erosa; but this term is inapplicable, for the perforations
and sinuosities are not the effect of erosion, but result from
the structure of the original. Polished sections, seen by
transmitted light, are represented in Dr. Fitton's memoir
(<i>Geol. Trans.</i> vol. iv.); and I have had many slices ground
as thin as possible, in the hope of detecting the characters
of the vascular tissue. In one example there are indications
of a cycadeous structure, which favour the conclusion, that
the originals belonged to an extinct tribe of gymnosperms;
but in other specimens, bundles of vascular tissue, resembling
those of palms, are apparent.</p>

<p>Large water-worn stems of <i>Endogenites</i> are occasionally
washed out of the Wealden cliffs at Hastings, and in Sandown
and Brook Bays, in the Isle of Wight.</p>

the <i>Conifer&aelig;</i>, or cone-bearing&mdash;so named from
the form of their fruit, of which the fir-cones and larch-juli

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"> 165 </a></span></p></div>

<p>The Conifers are all arborescent, having numerous branches,
which are in general disposed with much regularity. The
leaves are commonly acicular or needle-shaped, narrow, and
linear: in two or three genera, however, (<i>Dammara</i>, <i>Podocarpus</i>,)
the foliage departs remarkably from the ordinary type,
the leaves being broad and flat. The structure of the stem,
though in its general characters essentially exogenous (see
<i>Plate IV. fig. 4</i>),&mdash;that is, having a central pith, medullary
rays, zones of vascular tissue, and concentric circles of growth,&mdash;differs
in the almost entire absence of spiral vessels, and
in the peculiar modification of the radiating bands of woody
fibre, which are made up of uniform longitudinal vessels, and
run parallel with the medullary rays. The lateral walls of
these vessels have longitudinal rows of areol&aelig;, which are
generally circular or elliptical, but when in contact are
angular and polygonal: each areola has a small pore or
punctation in the centre. These discs, glands, or ducts, as
they are called, are variously arranged in different genera;
they are generally confined to the contiguous and corresponding
lateral surfaces of the fibres; and occur rarely, if
ever, on the inner and outer aspects of the vessels. In the
recent genus Pinus the rows of ducts are single in some
species; in others both single and double series occur, but
never more than two, and in the latter case the ducts are
always parallel to each other (see pl. v. 3<i>b</i>. <i>Wond.</i> pp. 696,
725). But in the <i>Araucari&aelig;</i>, or Norfolk Island Pines, the
vessels have double, triple, and sometimes quadruple, rows
of discs, of smaller size than in the common pines; and in
the double series, these bodies are always arranged alternately
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 696. <i>Bd.</i> 56 <i>a</i>.); Mr. Nicol states that
there are about 50 discs in the length of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> inch, the diameter
of each not exceeding <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1000</sub> inch.</p>

<p>The form and arrangement of these ducts, and the structure
of the medullary rays, are the characters on which the
scientific botanist relies for the detection of the affinities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"> 166 </a></span>
the coniferous trees, whose mineralized trunks and branches,
in a fragmentary state, are, for the most part, the only relics
of these important tribes of the lost floras of the earlier ages
of our planet.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a></p>

<p>The great value of these data will be shown in the sequel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The stems, fruit, and foliage, of Conifer&aelig;, occur in the
various fossiliferous deposits, from those containing the
earliest traces of terrestrial vegetation to the newest tertiary
strata; and a large proportion of the petrified wood found
in the British formations belongs to trees of this order.
The presence of rows of ducts on the ligneous fibres, which
is peculiar to this division of gymnosperms, as we have
already explained (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_58">p. 58</a>.), is so easily detected by
microscopic examination, that the merest fragment of
fossil coniferous wood retaining internal structure, may
without difficulty be recognized. The number of rows,
and the opposite or alternate arrangement of the areol&aelig;,
are characters which, in the living pines and firs, enable
us to refer the respective trees to European or exotic
forms; but in the fossil coniferous wood, much diversity
exists in other not less important points of structure, and
for the successful cultivation of this department of fossil
botany, works especially devoted to the subject must be
consulted. To the English student, Mr. Witham's beautiful
volume, "Observations on the Structure of Fossil
Vegetables, Edinburgh, 1831," will be found a valuable
guide.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL CONIFEROUS WOOD.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Coniferous Wood.</span>&mdash;The coniferous wood of the
secondary formations of England, belongs for the most part
to the Araucarian type: that is, the glands, when in
double rows, are placed alternately, as in the Norfolk Island
Pines (<i>Wond.</i> p. 696), and not side by side, as in the
common European species of firs and pines (<i>Bd.</i> p. 486).
Numerous sections of this kind of fossil wood are figured by
Mr. Witham, from specimens obtained from Lennel Braes,
on the banks of the Tweed, near Coldstream; and from
near Allanbank Mill, in Berwickshire (<i>Obs. Foss. Veg.</i> p. 14);
a fossil trunk, 40 feet long, discovered in Craigleith Quarry,
near Edinburgh, at a depth of 136 feet, possessed the same
structure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;oxylon</span> (<i>coniferous wood of the Coal Measures</i>).&mdash;The
existence of coniferous trees in the Carboniferous flora,
and the fact that their trunks and branches had contributed
to the formation of coal, was first discovered and clearly
demonstrated by Mr. Witham in the work to which reference
has been made. Figures of the peculiar structure observable
in thin slices of coal, are given in <i>Obs. Foss. Veg.</i> pl. iii. iv. v.
This carbonized wood resembles that of the Araucari&aelig; in
the multiple series of ducts, and their alternate arrangement;
but the presence of thick compound medullary rays in these
stems,&mdash;a character unknown in any living conifers,&mdash;led
M. Brongniart to place them in a separate genus&mdash;<i>Pal&aelig;oxylon</i>
(ancient wood); characterized by the presence of
medullary rays formed of numerous layers of cells, which
are not arranged in superimposed series, and that present
a lanceolate or oval form, in a section perpendicular to their
direction.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

figured in Mr. Witham's work, belong to this genus. It may interest
the reader to know that slices of these woods prepared for the microscope
by Mr. Nicol, (presented to me by the late Dr. Henry, of
Manchester,) not only expose the vegetable organization in an
admirable manner, but also form beautiful objects for the exhibition
of polarization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"> 168 </a></span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Peuce.</span>&mdash;Another species of coniferous wood from the
coal is thus named; it differs from the former in the medullary
rays being composed but of one layer of superposed
cells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Araucarites</span> (<i>Dadoxylon of Endlechen</i>).&mdash;This term is employed
to designate the fossil wood whose structure is apparently
identical with that of the living species of Araucari&aelig;,
having the same kind of medullary rays, and the ligneous
fibres studded with discs or areol&aelig;, which are polygonal,
often hexagonal, and disposed in several alternating series.
This wood is common in the Lias, Oolite, Wealden, and
Chalk.</p>

<p>Drifted fragments of coniferous wood of this type occur
in the Stonesfield slate, associated with leaves and fruits of
cycade&aelig;, and with marine shells, bones of reptiles, fishes,
and mammalia; at Scarborough, with the ferns and zami&aelig;
previously described; at Swindon, in the Portland oolite,
with belemnites, ammonites, trigoni&aelig;, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">STERNBERGIA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Sternbergia.</span>&mdash;To the Araucarian tribe, according to
the recent investigations of Professor Williamson, must be
referred certain fossil stems found in the coal-measures, and
named <i>Sternbergi&aelig;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> These are long solid cylindrical casts
of sandstone or clay, with annular constrictions, which are
generally invested with a thin film of carbonaceous matter;
when this crust is removed the surface is found to be
marked with longitudinal ridges. These fossils were once
supposed to be the stems of plants allied to Yucca or
Drac&aelig;na; but, as was first shown by Mr. Dawson and Mr.
Dawes,<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> they are merely sandstone casts of the medullary
axis or cylinder of an extinct genus of conifer&aelig;, allied
to the Araucari&aelig;: a specimen in which the cast was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"> 169 </a></span>
surrounded by a thick ligneous cylinder, heaving enabled
that acute observer to detect the structure of the original.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
The Sternbergi&aelig; are sandstone casts of central
cavities existing within the true pith; which cavities, under
some favourable conditions, were filled with inorganic materials.
Mr. Williamson is inclined to believe that all the
coniferous wood from the coal-measures, belonging to the
genus <i>Dadoxylon</i>, is referable to the trees of whose piths
the <i>Sternbergi&aelig; approximat&aelig;</i> are internal casts; and that
some of the foliaceous appendages of these trees have been
confounded with Lepidodendra.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

phenomena occur, it will suffice to state that a forest of
pines appears to have been submerged, and the trunks to
have become petrified, whilst standing erect on the spot
where they grew; the Cycads still shoot up as it were
between the stems, and the roots of the trees, though
changed into flint, extend into the bed of mould whence
they originally derived support, and which is so little
altered in appearance, as to be called the <i>Dirt-bed</i>, by the
quarrymen; thus realizing the fable of the petrified city in
Arabian story, whose inhabitants were turned into stone, in
the varied attitudes of life.</p>

<p>No foliage has been observed in connexion with these

<p>At Brook-point, in the Isle of Wight, an equally interesting
fact may be observed. At the base of the cliff, which is
entirely composed of Wealden clays, shales, and sandstones,
there is a vast accumulation of petrified firs and pines, imbedded
in the indurated grit that forms the lowermost strata on
the sea-shore, and of which the reefs and rocks, produced by
the encroachments of the sea, and that extend far from
land, are composed. These can be examined at low-water,
and the observer, upon lifting up the fuci and alg&aelig; which
cover them, will find the rocks and masses of stone to consist
of petrified trunks of conifer&aelig;. There are no erect trees
as in Portland; on the contrary, the stems are prostrate,
and lie confusedly intermingled, and associated with bones
of Iguanodons and other reptiles, and large mussel-shells;
the whole presenting the characters of a raft of forest trees
which had drifted down the stream of a vast river, and
entangled in its course the limbs and carcasses of animals
that were floating in the water, and the shells that inhabited
the river, and at length became submerged in the bed of
the delta or estuary. Both foliage and fruit have been
found in the Wealden deposits at Brook, and will be described
hereafter.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>In the sands of the Desert of Sahara, in Egypt,&mdash;among
the mammalian bones of the Sub-Himalayas,&mdash;and in the

trunks of conifers have been discovered.</p>

<p>Fossil trees of this family also occur in various localities
in Australia and Van Diemen's Land, the wood of which is
in some parts calcified, and in others silicified. The
same trunk often has externally a white friable calcareous
zone, several inches thick, traversed by veins of silex, or
opaline chalcedony, while the centre is a silicified mass; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"> 171 </a></span>

kind of fossil wood is to be seen in most cabinets, a large
quantity having been sent to England by emigrants.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> These
fossil trees appear to have been subjected to the same mutations
as those of the Isle of Portland, for they are described
as standing erect to the height of several feet in a bed of
arid sand, apparently in the places where they grew; their
petrified branches being scattered around them. They so
entirely preserve their natural appearance, that one of the
colonists mentions among the extraordinary sights he witnessed
on his first arrival in New Holland, the burning of
trees into lime to manure the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL CONIFER&AElig; OF AUSTRALIA.</div>

<p>A fossil pine forest, on the eastern coast of Australia, in
the inlet called Lake Macquarrie, is described by the Rev.
B. Clarke, as occurring at the base of a mountain range,
composed of conglomerate and sandstone, with subordinate
beds of lignite; an alluvial plain extends to the water's
edge, covering the sandstone rock which is seen <i>in situ</i>
beneath. Throughout this plain, stumps of fossil trees project
from the ground, and present the appearance of a forest
in which the trees have all been broken off at the same
level. At the distance of some yards from the shore, a reef
is formed by vertical rows of the petrified stems, which project
out of the water. Many of the fossil stems on the
strand have the remains of roots extending into the sandstone
below the alluvial deposit, and, like those in the Island
of Portland, are in some instances surrounded by an accumulation
of rock, which forms a mound of a higher level
than the surface of the stratum. The trunks are, generally,
three or four feet high, and from two to six feet in diameter.
The wood is silicified, and veins of chalcedony traverse its
substance between the concentric rings and medullary rays;
in several examples, from 60 to 120 annual circles of growth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"> 172 </a></span>
were observable. Beds of lignite occur in the neighbouring
hills, both above and below the fossil trees; many localities
along the eastern coast of Australia are mentioned, as
presenting similar phenomena. I may add that the only
fragment of petrified wood found by Mr. Walter Mantell in
New Zealand is coniferous.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Derwent, in Australia, opalized coniferous
trees of a similar character were observed under very
extraordinary circumstances, by the distinguished traveller,
Count Strzelecki. Truncated stems were found standing
erect in a bed of scoriaceous basalt (lava) and trachytic conglomerate:
but in some instances only basaltic casts of the
trunks remain. This curious phenomenon can only be explained
by supposing the silicified stems to have resisted the
intense heat of the incandescent lava, while trees placed in
circumstances unfavourable to their petrifaction were consumed:
but the latter, being either saturated with water, or
fresh and green, were burnt slowly, and left cylindrical moulds
in the cooled basaltic scori&aelig;, with impressions of the external
surface of the bark; these moulds were filled Tip by a subsequent
eruption, and thus basaltic casts of the consumed
trees were formed.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>In the Oxford and Kimmeridge Clays water-worn trunks
and branches of large pine-trees are often met with. An interesting
deposit of these remains was brought to light by
my youngest son (Mr. Reginald Mantell), when constructing
the branch line of railway from the Great Western to Trowbridge,
in Wilts. In the progress of the work, extensive
sections were cut through the Oxford Clay, and laid bare a
large quantity of drifted wood, much of which was not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"> 173 </a></span>
petrified, but in the state of bog-wood, and was used for
fuel by the workmen. Trunks ten or twelve feet long were
met with, to which serpul&aelig;, oysters (<i>Ostrea delta</i>), and other
shells were adherent. These vegetable remains were associated
with Belemnites, Belemnoteuthides, Ammonites, &amp;c.;
and had evidently been drifted far out to sea by currents.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>The White Chalk of England has afforded but few traces
of plants of this family. Fragments of coniferous wood are,
however, occasionally found in the state of carbonaceous, or
reddish brown friable masses, and when this substance is
removed, the surface of the chalk is seen to be marked with
impressions of ligneous fibres; sometimes the surface is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"> 175 </a></span>
studded over with little pyriform eminences, which are cretaceous
casts of perforations made by insects in the wood.
These specimens, when all traces of the wood are absent, are
very puzzling to those who are not aware of their origin.</p>

<p>Occasionally silicified fragments of wood are found imbedded
in flint. I have an interesting specimen of this kind
obtained from a wall in Lewes Priory (<a href="#lign_58"><i>Lign. 58</i></a>), and though
it must have been exposed to the influence of the weather
for nearly eight centuries, its surface still exhibits coniferous
structure.</p>

several species of pine (<i>Pinus</i>) and of yew (<i>Taxus</i>)
from those deposits are described by M. Brongniart. I have
collected fossils of this kind from the London Clay of the

of the same formation in England and
Germany. The branch here figured, from
the cabinet of S. H. Beckles, Esq. will serve
to illustrate the appearance of these fossil
plants. Some small fruits found in the
ironstone of Heathfield may possibly belong
to Cypresses. The foliage and fruit of five or six distinct
species of Thuites have been discovered in Tertiary strata.</p>

The specimens first found were from <i>Sultz-les-Bains</i>, near
Strasburgh. The leaves are alternate, arranged spirally, sessile,
and decurrent, and have much analogy with those of
certain Araucari&aelig;. The fruits are oblong cones, with cuneiform
scales, slightly imbricated, not contiguous, and generally
with from three to five lobes.</p>

which M. Brongniart has placed under this genus, because
the foliage of some species appears to have entered largely
into the formation of certain seams of coal, although the
perfect form of the leaves is unknown. The foliage referred
to N&#339;ggerathia consist of pinnated, or deeply pinnatifid,
simple leaves. These leaves, or leaflets, are either elongated,
linear, lanceolate, wedge-shaped or flabelliform, and entire,
or deeply lobed at their extremity, and are traversed by
numerous, fine, equal nerves, slightly diverging from the
base, but almost parallel. The affinities of these plants are
not satisfactorily made out: M. Brongniart considers them
to approach nearest to the Cycads or Conifers; perhaps
forming a connecting tribe between those two great groups
of gymnosperms.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

changed by mineralization. In a bed of fossil wood, near
Hythe, in Kent, a resin was found that partook of the properties
of amber and retinasphalt; it was of a clear red

<p><i>Amber</i>, so remarkable for its electrical properties, and so
largely used for ornamental purposes, is a fossil resin, the
product of an extinct species of pine (<i>Pinus succinifer</i>),
which, though nearly allied to <i>Pinus abies</i>, and <i>P. picea</i>, is
essentially distinct. The Amber in the European markets
is principally collected from the shores of the Baltic, between
Memel and Konigsberg, being washed out of submerged beds
of lignite, and thrown up on the strand by the waves.
Amber is occasionally found on the eastern and northern
shores of England. The forests of Amber-pines appear to
have been situated in the south-eastern part of what is now
the bed of the Baltic, in about 55&deg; north latitude, and 37&deg;
to 38&deg; east longitude, and were probably destroyed at the
commencement of the Drift period.</p>

<p>Insects, spiders, small crustaceans, leaves, and fragments
of vegetable tissue, are often imbedded in amber; and a few
hairs and feathers of mammalia and birds have been detected.
These organic bodies must have become immersed
in this substance when it exuded from the trees in a viscid
state, for they are often preserved as fresh and beautiful as
if recently embalmed in the liquid resin. Upwards of 800
species of insects have been discovered, chiefly referable to
Aptera, Diptera, Neuroptera, Coleoptera, Libellula, &amp;c.: by
far the greater number belong to extinct forms.</p>

<p>The vegetable remains comprise four species of pine, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"> 183 </a></span>
species of cedar, cypress, juniper, yew; and of oak, poplar,
beech, ash, &amp;c.; and a few ferns, mosses, liverworts, conferv&aelig;,
and fungi. The Amber appears to have exuded from
the bark and wood, but chiefly from the root-stock, as is
the case with the <i>Copal</i> and <i>Anim&eacute;</i>, which are resinous
substances obtained from certain trees in India and America,
and largely employed for varnish: these resins are often
substituted for true amber, especially when they contain
insects, &amp;c.; but the latter are always of the existing indigenous
species of the country. The difference observable in
the colour of the various species of amber, is attributable to
accidental chemical admixtures.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Palms</span> (<i>Palmacites</i>).&mdash;Reserving an account of the
fossil plants belonging to the other grand division of Dicotyledons,
the <i>Angiosperms</i> (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_61">p. 61</a>.), for the last section of
the present chapter, I proceed to notice the most important
family of the <i>Endogens</i>, or <i>Monocotyledons</i>, whose remains
occur abundantly in many tertiary deposits&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Palms</span>.</p>

<p>The Palms are, for the most part, lofty trees, having a
single cylindrical stem, which, like that of the arborescent
ferns, rises to a great height, and is crowned with a canopy
of foliage. The trunks are solid, most dense on the outer
part, and in some species (as the Cane-palms) are coated with
a thin siliceous epidermis. At a little distance above the
surface of the ground, strong, simple, rope-like roots are sent
off from the stem, appearing like clusters of stays or braces
to support the trunk; and the base of the petrified palm-trees
often exhibits vestiges of these organs.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The leaves
are supported by petioles, and are in most species very
large;<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> they are either pinnated or flabellated (fan-shaped),
and sometimes nearly split in half: the veins or nervures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"> 184 </a></span>
are parallel, and the interspaces plaited like the folds of a
fan. The surface of the stem is scored by transverse scars
formed by the separation of the petioles, and these markings
assist in the identification of the fossil trunks of palm-trees.
The fruit is in some kinds a single drupe, as the Cocoa-nut;
in others a cluster of soft pericarps, as the Date.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_159" id="Footnote_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_159"><span class="label">[159]</span></a> Specimens in the Brit. Mus. Petrifactions, p. 12.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_160" id="Footnote_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_160"><span class="label">[160]</span></a> In the Fan-palm (<i>Corypha</i>), the leaf is sometimes twenty feet
broad.</p></div>

<p>The Palm family is divided into upwards of sixty genera,
comprising more than a thousand species: the greater number
are inhabitants of tropical countries. Stems, with the
external surface and internal structure preserved, and the
foliage, and fruit, of several kinds of Palms, have been found
in a fossil state, and chiefly in the Tertiary formations. Examples
of the large silicified palm-stems from the West India
Islands, where they occur imbedded with corals petrified in
the same manner, are to be seen in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
and most public collections: and sliced polished sections,
exhibiting the monocotyledonous structure, are common in
private cabinets. The endogenous organization of the stems
is so obvious as to leave no doubt as to the class to which the
trees belong, but M. Brongniart states, that, in the absence
of the foliage and fruit, it is seldom possible to pronounce
with certainty that a fossil monocotyledonous stem belongs
to a Palm; for the internal structure alone does not enable
the botanist to fix upon any characters which will distinguish
the stems of Palms from those of Pandanus, Agave, Yucca,
Aloes, Drac&aelig;na, &amp;c. Fossil monocotyledons known by their
stems only, are therefore arranged by M. Brongniart under
the general name of <i>Endogenites</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_161" id="Footnote_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_161"><span class="label">[161]</span></a> Petrifactions, p. 52.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Palmacites carbonigenus</i> of Corda, and other supposed
palm-trees of the Coal formation, are regarded by the same
eminent botanist as essentially differing in structure from
this family, and belonging to an extinct tribe of exogens.</p>

<p>That a large proportion of the exogenous stems found in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"> 185 </a></span>
the Tertiary deposits are true palms, there can, however, be
no doubt, for the foliage and fruit, which are occasionally
associated with them, confirm the inference drawn from the
characters of the trunks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PALM LEAVES.</div>

<p>Stems, leaves, and fruits of Palms have been discovered
in the Paris basin, by M. Ad. Brongniart (<i>Bd.</i> pl. lxiv. p. 515);
and silicified trunks in many other places on the Continent;
but no fossils of this kind surpass in beauty and interest
those which are found in the West Indies. A slice of a silicified
stem from Antigua is represented, as seen by reflected
light, in <i>Plate V. fig. 1</i>; it admirably displays bundles of vessels
imbedded in cellular tissue.</p>

<p>Silicified stems of monocotyledons, related to the Palms,
are very widely distributed, and have been collected among
mammalian remains in Ava, and in the Sub-Himalaya
mountains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Palm-leaves.</span>&mdash;The pinnated and fan-shaped
leaves of the Palms are so peculiar as to be easily recognized
in a fossil state. Though many specimens have been
found in the tertiary strata of the Continent, but two or
three examples have been met with in England. The first
discovered British specimen is in my cabinet, and was obtained
by Mr. Fowlstone, of Ryde, from the fresh-water limestone
of Whitecliff Bay, in the Isle of Wight. It is thirteen
inches in length, and eleven in width: fresh-water shells
and plants are imbedded with it. It is figured in Geol. I.
of Wight, <i>2d edit.</i> p. 431. This species (<i>Palmacites Lamanonis</i>)
occurs also at Aix in Provence, in great perfection,
associated with Insects, Fishes, fresh-water shells, &amp;c. (<i>Wond.</i>
p. 260. <i>Petrif.</i> p. 62).</p>

<p>Twelve species of palm-leaves are enumerated by M.
Unger, from the Tertiary deposits of the Continent. One
species has been found in the Chalk formation of Silesia;
the most ancient strata in which the remains of undoubted
palms have as yet been observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"> 186 </a></span></p>

<p>The fossil palm-leaves of the pinnated form are named
<i>Ph&#339;nicites</i>,<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and examples occur in the Tertiary grits of
Puy en Velais, I am not aware that leaves of this type have
been found in England: diligent research in our tertiary leaf-beds
(at Whitecliff Bay, Alum Bay, Bournemouth, Wareham)
will probably sooner or later discover them. The
leaflets have a well-marked median nerve, with fine nervures
running parallel with it; a character by which the
foliage of <i>Ph&#339;nicites</i> may be distinguished from that of the
Cycade&aelig;.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_162" id="Footnote_162"></a><a href="#FNanchor_162"><span class="label">[162]</span></a> From <i>Ph&#339;nix dactylifera</i>: the Date-Palm.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Fruits of Palms.</span>&mdash;Although certain fruits found
in the coal-measures have been referred to the palm-tribe by
M. Unger, Dr. Lindley, and other botanists, M. Brongniart
is of opinion that no such identification can be established;
the same remark applies to the Carpolithes from the Oolite;
in fine, the Tertiary deposits have alone yielded fruits that
can be unquestionably referred to plants of this order. The
most productive British locality of fossil fruits of Palms,
and of many other vegetables, is the Island of Sheppey; and
I purpose describing in this place, not only the remains of
this family, but also of the other plants associated with
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL FRUITS OF THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Fruits of the Isle of Sheppey.</span>&mdash;This little
island, which is situated in the mouth of the Thames, is
entirely composed of the London Clay, with bands of septaria.
On the north, there is a range of cliffs, about two hundred
feet high, which is being continually undermined by
the waves, and large masses of the clay are thrown down,
and innumerable fruits, seeds, branches and stems of trees,
and other fossils, are exposed on the strand at low-water.
The vegetables are strongly impregnated with iron pyrites,
and as this mineral speedily decomposes when exposed to
the atmosphere, the choicest examples often fall to pieces,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"> 187 </a></span>
even when preserved in the cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The nodular masses
of indurated clay, termed septaria, contain the best preserved
and most durable fossils. The fossil fruits, or carpolithes,
occur in such profusion, that a large collection can
easily be made; they comprise several hundred species, few
of which have been scientifically investigated.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

fruits, keeps them in stopper-bottles filled with water, placing the
different species separately, and labelling the phials. I have successfully

brushing in the varnish with a stiff hair-pencil.</p>

<p>Mr. Parkinson has given admirable figures of several of
the Sheppey fruits, particularly of the large palm-like nuts,
called "<i>petrified figs</i>" (<i>Org. Rem.</i> vol. i. pl. vi. vii. <i>Pict.
Atlas</i>, pl. vi. vii.) M. Ad. Brongniart has named several in
his <i>Prodrome</i>; but without figures the descriptions are
useless to the student. Mr. Bowerbank has published two
numbers of a work entitled, "<i>History of the Fossil Fruits of
the London Clay</i>," with seventeen plates; from which I have
selected a few subjects for illustration. The fruits described

<p><span class="smcap">Nipadites.</span> <a href="#lign_63"><i>Lign. 63</i></a>. (<i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. vi. vii.)&mdash;The
most remarkable fruits in the above catalogue are those
which, from their appearance when compressed, are known
to collectors by the name of "<i>petrified figs</i>" (<a href="#lign_63"><i>Lign.</i> 63, <i>fig.</i>
9, 10</a>). Some specimens attain a considerable size, and are
from five to seven inches long. The nut, and the pericarp
or shell, are often well preserved. These fossils were referred
to the <i>Cocos</i> by Mr. Parkinson, but they have not a ligneous
endocarp with three pores as in the Cocoa-nut.</p>

<p>Mr. Bowerbank has shown that they are nearly related to
the fruit of the <span class="smcap">Nipa</span>, or Molucca-Palm, a tree which abounds
in Bengal, and in the Molucca and Philippine Islands. The
Nip&aelig; are low, shrub-like plants, having the general aspect
of palms; they grow in marshy tracts, at the mouths of
great rivers, particularly where the waters are brackish.
They are allied to the Cocoa-nut tribe, on the one hand, and
to the <i>Pandanus</i>, or Screw-pine, on the other.</p>

<p>The <i>Nipadites</i>, according to Mr. Bowerbank, have the epicarp
and endocarp thin and membranous, and the sarcocarp
thick and pulpy, and composed of cellular tissue, through
which run numerous bundles of vessels. Nearly in the
centre of the pericarp is situated a large seed which, when
broken, is more or less hollow. This seed consists of regular
layers of cells, radiating from a spot situated near the
middle, and apparently inclosing a central embryo.</p>

<p>The same author remarks, that "if the habits of the plants
to which the fossil fruits belonged were similar to those of
the recent <i>Nipa</i>, it will account for their abundance in the
London Clay in the Isle of Sheppey; which formation, from
the great variety of stems and branches, mixed up with star-fishes,
shells of mollusks, and bones of fishes, crustaceans,
and reptiles of numerous marine and fresh-water genera, is
strikingly characteristic of the delta of a river, which probably
flowed from near the Equator towards the spot where
these interesting relics are deposited." The fact that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"> 191 </a></span>
seed-vessels of several species of Nipadites abound in the Isle
of Sheppey, and have not been observed in any other locality
in England, tends to support this opinion.</p>

<p>Carpolithes of this kind occur in great perfection in the
Eocene strata of Belgium, and were figured and described,
nearly seventy years since, in Burton's "<i>Oryctographie de
Bruxelles</i>," as petrified cocoa-nuts; the uncompressed state
in which these fossils occur makes the resemblance to the
recent fruit more striking than in the flattened pyritous
specimens from the clay of Sheppey.</p>

<p>The <i>Nipadites</i> of Brussels have recently been brought
under the more immediate notice of English geologists, in
a memoir "On the Tertiary Strata of Belgium and French
Flanders," by Sir Charles Lyell, in which several specimens
are figured and described.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> These fossils are found in sands
and sandstone, presumed to be of the age of the Bracklesham
beds of Sussex. They are procured from Schaerbeek, in the
northern suburbs of Brussels, where extensive quarries are
worked for paving-stones, and have long been celebrated for
remains of turtles, trunks of palms, and dicotyledonous trees,
and the fruits, now called Nipadites. The vegetable remains
often occur silicified; Sir C. Lyell was shown by the workmen
"the trunk of a petrified exogenous tree, with forty
rings of annual growth; it had lain in a horizontal position,
and was bored by teredin&aelig;. The silicified base of the trunk
of a Palm-tree, apparently broken off short at about the level
of the soil, had numerous air-roots, or rootlets, attached."<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Of the thirteen species of Nipadites enumerated by Mr.
Bowerbank, some of which are, however, only accidental
varieties, four have been identified among those obtained
from Schaerbeek: two of them belong to but one species&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"> 192 </a></span>
<i>Nipadites Burtoni</i>: the others are <i>N. lanceolata</i> (<a href="#lign_63"><i>Lign.
63, fig. 9</i></a>), and <i>N. Parkinsoni</i> (<i>Pictorial Atlas</i>, plate vii.).
These fossil nuts closely resemble the fruit of <i>Nipas fruticans</i>,
a palm which abounds in the delta of the Ganges, and other
parts of Bengal, and is the only living species of the genus
known.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In an immature or abortive specimen of <i>Nipadites

ripe fruit (<a href="#lign_63"><i>Lign. 63. fig. 9</i></a>) is well marked. The largest
specimen of Nipadites from Schaerbeek, is above seven inches
long and four wide. The arenaceous strata containing these
fruits, and stems of palms and dicotyledonous trees, are supposed
to have been formed in the sea near the mouth of a
river, as in the case of the clay-beds at Sheppey: the vegetable
remains are associated with bones of fresh-water Turtles,

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Fruit of Pandanus.</span> (<i>Popocarya.</i> <i>Bd.</i> pl. lxii.
p. 503.)&mdash;The <i>Pandanace&aelig;</i> are monocotyledonous trees,
named Screw Pines from the spiral insertion of their long,
rigid, sword-like leaves, along the stem; they are natives of
hot climates, and abound in the groups of islands in the
Pacific; being generally the first important vegetable tenants
of the newly-formed Atols or coral-islands. As in the palms,
the stem is supported near the base by long side-roots, which
enable these trees to maintain an erect position, and flourish
on the newly-elevated coral-reefs, where but little soil has
accumulated.</p>

<p>The existence of this tribe of plants during the secondary
ages is known only by a single example of a fossil fruit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"> 193 </a></span>
which was discovered by Mr. Page, of Bishport, in the
Inferior Oolite, to the east of Charmouth, Dorsetshire, and
is preserved in the museum at Oxford; no vestiges of the

<p>This carpolithe, (for a detailed account and figures see <i>Bd.</i>
p. 504, pl. lxiii.) is of the size of a large orange; the surface is
covered with a stellated epicarpium, composed of hexagonal
tubercles forming the summits of cells which occupy the
entire circumference of the fruit. Each cell contains a single
seed, usually hexagonal, resembling a small grain of rice,
and is supported by a
foot-stalk, formed of
dense fibres; a character
exhibited only by
the seed-vessels of Pandanus.
The fossil fruit
differs from that of
the recent Screw-pines
in the seeds being
neither inclosed in a
hard nut, nor collected
into drupes, but dispersed
uniformly over
the entire mass; this
forms the essential generic
distinction between
them. Dr. Buckland
has named this
unique carpolithe <i>Podocarya</i>.

<p><span class="smcap">Wood perforated by Teredin&aelig;.</span> <a href="#lign_65"><i>Lign. 65.</i></a>&mdash;The drifted
trunks and masses of wood found in the London Clay, at
Sheppey, Bognor, Bracklesham, &amp;c., some of which belong
to Palms, others to Conifers, and Dicotyledons, are commonly
more or less perforated by the boring mollusks called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"> 194 </a></span>
<i>Teredo</i>, or <i>Teredina</i>; and remains of their testaceous tubes
are often well preserved. The tortuous channels excavated
in the wood by these borers, are lined or filled up with calcareous
spar, indurated clay, or other mineral matter, of
various shades of grey, blue, yellow, &amp;c.; and the polished slabs
of this fossil wood are beautifully diversified by the sections
of the sparry tubes, crossed at right angles by the ligneous
structure; as in the specimen <a href="#lign_65"><i>fig. 1, Lign. 65</i></a>, from the Canal

<p>In the fossil, <a href="#lign_65"><i>fig. 2. Lign. 65</i></a>, from the Isle of Sheppey,

of the surface of the block of wood having decayed and been

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Liliace&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The family of endogens, termed <i>Liliace&aelig;</i>,
comprises many beautiful plants; those with annual
stems, as the Lily, Hyacinth, Tulip, &amp;c. are well known for
the variety and splendour of their blossoms; some of the
arborescent forms, as the Tulip-tree, attain a large size, but
the flowers of this division are relatively small. In tertiary
strata, the stems, leaves, fruits, and even the imprints of
flowers, have been discovered, of plants related to <i>Sagittaria</i>
(Arrow-head), <i>Smilax</i> (Bind-weed), <i>Convallaria</i> (Lily of the
valley), &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Drac&aelig;na (<i>Dragon-blood tree</i>), a tall, slender, elegant
tree with amplexicaul leaves (common in our hot-houses),
belongs to this family; and certain stems found with Clathrari&aelig;,
and bones of the Iguanodon, in the Kentish-rag at
Maidstone (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_173">p. 173</a>.), so closely resemble the trunk of
this plant, that they have been named by Mr. K&ouml;nig,<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
<i>Drac&aelig;na Benstedi</i>; the specimens are in the British Museum.
Until the internal structure of these fossils has been examined,
the correctness of this identification is, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"> 195 </a></span>
uncertain: the external resemblance to the stem of the
Drac&aelig;na consists in the interrupted annular ridges, denoting
amplexicaul leaves: no vestiges of the foliage have been
observed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FRESH-WATER PLANTS. FOSSIL CHAR&AElig;.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Fresh-water Plants.</span>&mdash;The tertiary fresh-water
strata often contain abundance of the remains of the aquatic
vegetables that inhabited the lakes and rivers in which
those deposits were formed. The remains of several species
of the common lacustrine plant, the <i>Chara</i>, are found in
immense quantities in the fresh-water limestones and marls
of the Isle of Wight, of the coast of Hampshire, and of the
Paris Basin. The shell-marls, still in progress of formation
in the lakes of Scotland, and the travertine precipitated
from thermal springs, in like manner envelop and preserve
the leaves and fruits of recent species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Fruits of Chara.</span> (<i>Gyrogonites.</i>) <a href="#lign_66"><i>Lign.</i> 66.</a>&mdash;The
Chara is a well-known inhabitant of almost every stream
and rivulet. The stems are hollow, and composed of tubes
filled with a fluid in which green globules circulate; they
form beautiful microscopic objects for exhibiting the circulation
in vegetables. The fruit consists of very small nuclei,
contained in a calcareous pericarp, composed of five spirally
twisted plates, that unite at the summit. These seed-vessels,
when first discovered in a fossil state, were supposed to be
the shells of mollusks, and a genus was formed for their
reception with the name of <i>Gyrogonites</i> (<i>twisted-stones</i>); a
term still employed, though the vegetable nature of these
bodies is well known. In <i>Plate III. fig. 5</i>, a branch of the
common Chara with seeds is represented: and figures of the
seed-vessels, of two fossil species are given in <a href="#lign_66"><i>Lign. 66,

<p><i>Fossil Nymphe&aelig;.</i> <a href="#lign_66"><i>Lign. 66, fig. 4.</i></a>&mdash;Those magnificent
aquatic plants, the Water-Lilies (<i>Nymphe&aelig;</i>), that adorn our
rivers and lakes with flowers and foliage which partake more
of the characters of an exotic flora than any other of our
indigenous plants, are also found fossil in the lacustrine marls
and limestones of the tertiary formations of France; but the
nature of these remains could only be recognized by a profound
botanist, for they consist of impressions of the internal
structure of the stems, which, however, is so peculiar, that
no reasonable doubt of their origin can be entertained. Two
imprints on a piece of limestone from Lonjumeau, presented
to me by the late M. Alex. Brongniart, are figured in <a href="#lign_66"><i>Lign. 66,
fig. 4</i></a>; some minute seed-vessels (<a href="#lign_66"><i>Lign. 66, fig. 3</i></a>), found with
them, closely resemble those of <i>Nymphe&aelig;</i>, and are supposed
to belong to the same plants (<i>Class. V&eacute;g. Foss.</i> p. 72).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Flowers.</span>&mdash;The tertiary limestones of Monte Bolca
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 565), so rich in ichthyolites, and other fossil
remains of great interest, contain leaves, and even flowers,
of liliaceous plants. The specimen figured (<a href="#lign_67"><i>Lign. 67, fig. 3</i></a>)
is in the Museum at Paris, and described by M. Brongniart
under the name of <i>Antholithes</i> (stone-flower) <i>liliaceus</i>; it
consists of the corolla and calyx: the anthers and pistils have
not been observed in any example. The discovery of this
fossil should excite the young collector to search diligently
for such objects in the tertiary strata of England.</p>

partaken but little of a geological arrangement, yet the
reader may have observed, that a large proportion of the
vegetables composing the floras of the ancient secondary
formations, belonged to the Cryptogamous and Gymnospermous
classes. A striking contrast is presented in the geological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"> 198 </a></span>
position of the mineralized dicotyledonous plants, of
existing genera. These abound in the tertiary strata, and
generally in an inverse ratio to the antiquity of the deposit,
while their remains are almost wholly absent in the older
rocks; neither have there been discovered in the Tertiary,
any beds of vascular cryptogamia, at all approaching the
immense accumulations in the Carboniferous formations.</p>

<p>The most remarkable exception, is the single instance of
a large leaf of a dicotyledonous plant in the Trias, or New

<p>It would be impossible, within the limits necessarily
assigned to these volumes, to offer even a general view of
the fossil remains of this grand class of vegetables; our
remarks must be limited to a few interesting examples and
localities.</p>

<p>When stems of dicotyledonous trees only are found, but
little certainty can be obtained as to the family to which
they belonged; the foliage of many well-known genera offer
more positive characters; the flowers are rarely in a state
of preservation to afford any valuable data; but the fruits,
or seed-vessels, are frequently well preserved, and these may
enable the botanist to arrive at precise determinations as to
generic, and, perhaps, specific relations.</p>

<p>The tertiary marls of Aix, in Provence, which abound
in insects, crustaceans, and lacustrine shells, contain many
kinds of dicotyledonous leaves, associated with those of palms.
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 260.)</p>

<p>The Lignite, or Brown-coal deposits, are almost entirely
composed of dicotyledonous trees, belonging to many genera,
which are inhabitants of Europe; namely, the Poplar, Willow,
Elm, Chestnut, Walnut, Sycamore, Maple, Linden, Buckthorn,
Vine, &amp;c. (<i>Bd.</i> vol. i. pp. 508-514.)</p>

<p>The beds of brown coal, on the banks of the Rhine, are
literally carbonized submerged forests, which in some remote
period were drifted from the interior of the Continent
into a vast lake or gulf; for the trees bear evident marks of
transport, and are destitute of roots and branches. These
masses resemble the rafts of forest trees, which are daily
floated down the Mississippi into the Atlantic, where they
become engulfed in the profound depths of the ocean, and
probably will be converted into coal or lignite; and in
future ages, may be elevated above the waters, become
dry land, and present to the then existing communities

celebrated lacustrine tertiary formation of &#338;ningen, whose
fossil reptiles and mammalia we shall have to notice hereafter,
contains a rich assemblage of dicotyledonous and gymnospermous
ligneous vegetables, with a few ferns and grasses.
Not only branches and leaves of a species of Vine<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> occur,
but even the fruit; fossil grapes being found in these deposits;<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
there are also many aquatic plants. A descriptive list
of these fossils, by Professor Braun, of Carlsruhe, is given by
Dr. Buckland. The brown-coal of this basin is in thin beds
of but little economical importance, but so rich in the vegetation
of the miocene tertiary period, that a few days spent
in collecting those treasures will amply reward the intelligent
tourist who may visit Constance. (See <i>Wond.</i> p. 263.)</p>

<p>The foliage of dicotyledonous trees frequently occurs in
the Eocene marls and limestones, and in some localities in
considerable abundance, and in beautiful preservation. Near
Bournemouth, on the Hampshire coast, the leaves of many
species are met with in a bed of sandy marl, between three
and four feet thick: the vegetable substance is carbonized;
some of the leaves are referable to the <i>Laurace&aelig;</i> and <i>Amentace&aelig;</i>,
others to the <i>Charace&aelig;</i>;<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> a similar deposit of tertiary
plants has been discovered near Wareham. These beds belong

<p>The red marlstone associated with lignite in the plastic
clay beds at Castle Hill, Newhaven (<i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 54),
contains leaves of a similar kind; a seed-vessel of a coniferous
tree has also been found in it.</p>

<p>Some of the most interesting examples of dicotyledonous
leaves that have come under my notice, are from the Sub-Apennine
tertiary strata, at Stradella, near Pavia. They
belong to several genera of arborescent, or at least ligneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"> 202 </a></span>
plants, and most of them to species which still grow in
Italy. In some examples the substance of the leaves is
changed into carbon, and the structure well preserved; but,
in general, sharp imprints on the stone are the only traces of
the originals. They are found in a gypseous marl, of a
cream colour; and, from their perfect state, it is inferred
that they were enveloped in the soft matrix immediately
after their fall, and preserved by the rapid crystallization of
the gypsum. Two specimens from my cabinet are figured in
<i>Plate III.</i> <i>figs.</i> 4 and 8; and outlines of a few other examples,
in <a href="#lign_68"><i>Lign. 68</i></a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpolithes</span> (<i>Fossil Fruits</i>).&mdash;In the description of the
fossil fruits from the Isle of Sheppey, several kinds of dicotyledons
were included. Many species also abound in the
lignites of Germany, France, and Italy; in those near Frankfort,
seed-vessels of the Maple, Elm, Hornbeam, Birch, Willow,
and Walnut, &amp;c. In the environs of Turin, fruits of
a species of Walnut (<i>Juglans</i>, <a href="#lign_67"><i>Lign. 67</i></a>), occur in the newer
tertiary deposits, and are called Turin-nuts; the ligneous
envelope has perished, but the form of its surface, and of the
inclosed kernel, is preserved in calcareous spar. These nuts
differ, both in the pericarp and kernel, from the living species:
the lobes are simple (<a href="#lign_67"><i>Lign. 67, fig. 4<sup>b</sup></i></a>), and not subdivided
as in the common walnut; a species has been discovered at
Lons-le-Saulnier, in which the lobes are mamillated.</p>

<p>Two kinds of fruits belonging to plants of the order <i>Ranunculace&aelig;</i>,
and related to <i>Thalictrum</i> (<i>Meadow-rue</i>), have
been found in the eocene deposits of France and England;
one in the Paris basin, (<i>meuli&egrave;re du terrain d'eau douce sup&eacute;rieur</i>,)
by M. Alexandre Brongniart, and the other in the
Isle of Wight, by Mr. Webster. In the specimen from the
last-named locality the pericarp is carbonized, and its cavity
filled with clay. Figures of these seed-vessels are given in
<a href="#lign_67"><i>Lign.</i> 67, <i>figs.</i> 1, 2</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carpolithes Smithi&aelig;.</span>&mdash;I would notice in this place some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"> 203 </a></span>
very remarkable fossil fruits that are occasionally met with
in the White Chalk of Sussex and Kent, and appear to belong
to dicotyledonous trees. The first specimen was discovered
by me in a chalk-pit near Lewes, and is described in my
"Fossils of the South Downs:" some illustrative examples
collected by Mrs Smith, of Tunbridge Wells, tending to elucidate
the nature of the original more satisfactorily than those
in my collection, are figured and described by me in the
Journal of the Geological Society, 1843, under the above
name. These fruits are of an oval form, about one and a half
inch long, and one inch wide, and are pressed almost flat.
They are of a rich burnt-sienna colour, mottled with white,
from the chalk having permeated their substance, and are
studded over with slight eminences, which are the exposed
summits of oblong flattened seeds. Although the internal
structure is not preserved, there can be no doubt that the
originals were spurious compound berries, having, like the
Mulberry, the seeds imbedded in a soft pulpy mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL DICOTYLEDONOUS TREES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Dicotyledonous Trees.</span>&mdash;The occurrence of trunks
and branches of angiospermous trees in a carbonized state
has already been described; like the monocotyledons and
conifers, they also occur silicified.</p>

<p>The most beautiful specimens I have seen are from the
Lybian and Egyptian deserts, and were collected by my friend,
the late Colonel Head. In these the most delicate vascular
tissue is permeated by chalcedony and jasper, and the vessels
are filled with silex of a bright vermilion and blue colour,
while the cellular structure is of a rich yellow. Fragments of
these fossil trees are scattered everywhere among the sands
of the desert; the most interesting locality is an irregular plateau,
which reposes on marine limestone, considerably above
the level of the Nile, about seven miles east by south from
Cairo. This district is called the <i>petrified forest</i>, from the
immense quantities of silicified trees with which it is covered.
It is thus graphically described by a late traveller:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"> 204 </a></span></p>

<p>"Having passed the tombs of the Caliphs, just beyond the
gates of Cairo, we proceed to the southward nearly at right
angles to the road, across the Desert to Suez: and after
travelling some ten miles up a low barren valley covered with
sand, gravel, and sea-shells, fresh as if the tide had retired
but yesterday, we cross a low range of sand-hills, which has
for some distance run parallel to our path. The scene now
presented is beyond conception singular and desolate. Heaps
of fragments of large trees converted into stone everywhere
meet the eye, and when struck by our horses' hoofs rang like
cast iron; they extend for miles in the form of a decayed and
prostrate forest; and the appearance is so natural, that were
it in Scotland or Ireland, it would pass without remark as a
drained bog, on which the exhumed trees lay rotting in the
sun. The roots, and rudiments of the branches, are in many
cases nearly perfect, and in some the worm-holes eaten under
the bark are distinctly recognizable."<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_178" id="Footnote_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_178"><span class="label">[178]</span></a> Bombay Times.</p></div>

<p>Many of the trunks are scattered over the surface, among
rolled and angular fragments of dark grit, and pebbles of
jasper,<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> chert, and quartz. The large trunks occur in great
numbers on dark-coloured knolls, where they lie, like the
broken stems of a prostrate forest, crossing each other at
various angles. Two of the largest measured respectively
forty-eight, and sixty feet in length, and two and a half, and
three feet in diameter, at the base. With but two or three
exceptions, all the specimens examined microscopically, are
dicotyledons. No traces of seed-vessels or leaves have been
detected.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_179" id="Footnote_179"></a><a href="#FNanchor_179"><span class="label">[179]</span></a> The jaspers are known to lapidaries as <i>Egyptian Pebbles</i>.</p></div>

<p>The situation and condition of these petrified forests, indicate
great changes in the relative position of the land and sea
in that part of Egypt; for the trees must have grown on the
dry land formed by the elevated bottom of a former ocean;
which must have subsided, and been covered by beds of sand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"> 205 </a></span>
and pebbles; another elevatory movement must have raised
the entire series of deposits to their present situation, and
the retiring waters have removed the loose portions of the
last formed strata, and dispersed them, with fragments of the
silicified trees, over the surface of the Egyptian and Lybian
deserts.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DICOTYLEDONOUS OF THE CRETACEOUS EPOCH.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dicotyledons of the Cretaceous Epoch.</span>&mdash;Among the
crowd of interesting facts relating to the botanical character
of the earlier periods of geology which recent observations
have brought to light, one discovery demands especial notice,
and I have reserved it for this place, rather than introduce
it in an earlier section.</p>

<p>In the neighbourhood of Aix-la-Chapelle the lower members
of the Cretaceous formation, viz. the Greensand, Galt,
and Chalk-marl, are well developed, and comprise a series
of littoral deposits of the great Chalk ocean that extended
westwardly between France and England, on both sides of
the existing Channel, and eastwardly over North and Central
Germany, Sweden, Poland, and Russia, far into Asia.
The series of strata at Aix-la-Chapelle is several hundred
feet in thickness, and the lowermost beds lie immediately
on the Carboniferous rocks of the country.</p>

<p>Dr. M. H. Debey,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> to whose scientific labours we are indebted
for an accurate knowledge of these interesting facts,
divides these cretaceous deposits into four groups, the lowermost
of which appears to be the equivalent of our Greensand;
it consists of beds of clay and sand, the middle portion
abounding in stems, leaves, and fruit, and the resin of coniferous
trees.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The epidermis of the leaves often occurs in a carbonized
state, and is recognizable by its microscopic structure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"> 206 </a></span>
Xylophagous mollusks are found in the petrified and carbonized
wood. Fresh-water Desmidiace&aelig;, and a few marine
remains, are associated with this fossil flora, which is distinguished
by the abundance of Ferns and dicotyledonous leaves,
and the scarcity of Cycads; among them are undoubted
<i>Proteace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>The specimens collected by M. Debey from the lower cretaceous
beds are the following:</p>

<p>Alg&aelig;, 15. Filices, 28. Hydropterid&aelig;, 2. Cycade&aelig;, 5.
Naiade&aelig;, 5. Palm&aelig;, 1. Conifer&aelig;, 20. Juliflor&aelig;, 5. Credneri&aelig;,

<p>This assemblage of angiosperms, with gymnosperms, and
cryptogamia, at the commencement of the Cretaceous epoch,
when the Iguanodon and other reptilian forms of the
Oolite and Wealden still inhabited the land and water,
proves, as Sir Charles Lyell has remarked,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> that the meteorological
phenomena of that remote period differed in no

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> we pass from the consideration of details of structure,
and of botanical affinities, to a general survey of the
mineralized remains of the vegetable kingdom, we perceive
that from the pal&aelig;ozoic deposits, to those which are contemporaneous
with the human race,&mdash;from the coal-measures
to the peat-bogs of modern times,&mdash;vast accumulations of
vegetable matter, in various states of carbonization, have
been produced from the imbedded relics of the terrestrial
floras that flourished during the respective periods of their
formation; petrifaction, or the transmutation of vegetable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"> 207 </a></span>
tissues into stone, from the infiltration of siliceous, calcareous,
or metallic solutions, being an accidental process,
dependent on the physical conditions under which the trees
and plants were submerged, and entombed in the strata.</p>

<p>Although the entire system of vegetable life which prevailed
during the earlier ages of the world is but partially
revealed by the fossil remains which geological researches
have brought under the examination of the naturalist,&mdash;for
numerous tribes of plants may have existed of which no
traces have been detected, while of species of delicate tissues
all vestiges may have perished,&mdash;yet a review of the facts
hitherto obtained, presents some highly important and unexpected
results, as to the characters of the successive floras
which prevailed during the pal&aelig;ozoic, secondary, and tertiary
epochs. And though deductions of this nature must,
in the present state of our knowledge, be regarded in the
light of shifting hypotheses to be modified or abandoned
with the progress of discovery,&mdash;yet the predominating types
which characterize the flora of one system of formations,
differ so essentially from those of another, that it may be
reasonably inferred such apparent distinctions are the effect
of organic laws, and not illusions arising from our misinterpretation
of the natural records of former conditions of the
vegetable world.</p>

<p>The absence in the most ancient deposits of the entire
class of Angiosperms, or flowering plants, which constitutes
the leading features of the floras with which we are familiar,&mdash;the
abundance of unknown types of Cryptogamia, and the
extinction or disappearance of those tribes in the succeeding
formations, and the prevalence of new species and genera
belonging to another class;&mdash;the predominance in one flora,
both in number and variety, of certain tribes, and their decadence
in the next period; while a family subordinate in
the antecedent epoch, and known but by a small number of
species, suddenly acquires a pre-eminence both in numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"> 208 </a></span>
and variety;&mdash;are phenomena, which the facts brought before
us in the course of this argument, present in a striking
point of view.</p>

<p>Assuming these data as the basis of a philosophical
generalization, M. Brongniart arranges the known species
of fossil plants into three grand systems, which correspond
with the great geological periods, comprehended in the pal&aelig;ozoic,
secondary, and tertiary formations.</p>

<p>The first or most ancient flora is characterized by the
predominance of <i>Cryptogamic Acrogens</i>&mdash;the <i>Ferns</i> and
<i>Club-mosses</i>; the second by the large development of the
<i>Dicotyledonous Gymnosperms</i>&mdash;the <i>Cycads</i> and <i>Conifers</i>: the
third by the appearance and prevalence of the <i>Angiosperms</i>,
both dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous. The following
table presents a concise view of the results of M. Brongniart's
investigation.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>It must be observed that this table is only designed to
indicate the successive <i>predominance</i> of each of the three
classes of the vegetable kingdom, in the respective epochs,
and not the entire exclusion of the others. Thus, in the two
first, both Acrogens and Gymnosperms existed; but in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"> 209 </a></span>
first period the former greatly exceeded the latter, both in
number and magnitude; while in the next the Gymnosperms
acquired the ascendancy; but in both these epochs, from
the Devonian to the Wealden inclusive, very few if any
Angiosperms, or flowering dicotyledons, existed. With the
Cretaceous period the Angiosperms appear in great numbers,
and in the Tertiary epochs acquire the importance
they possess in the existing floras.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I must direct attention to a remarkable
character of the pal&aelig;ozoic and secondary floras, namely, the
almost entire absence of the <i>Gramine&aelig;</i> or Grasses, which constitute
so large a proportion of the existing vegetation.</p>

<p>Above six hundred species of plants have been discovered
in the British strata;<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> and yet two species of <i>Poa</i> (a tribe
of grasses), from Coalbrook Dale, are the only known examples
of Gramine&aelig;. It has been suggested that the greater
or lesser durability of the foliage of certain vegetables, may
have occasioned their presence or absence in the carboniferous
deposits, and experiments were instituted by Dr. Lindley
with the view of determining this question. But though
it was found that, when the foliage of various families was
subjected to long maceration, the leaves of dicotyledons and
grasses disappeared, while those of ferns and cycads remained,
this fact does not meet the exigencies of the case,
for we have no evidence to show that the fossil leaves were
ever placed in similar conditions; on the contrary, there is
reason to conclude that they were imbedded under circumstances
that arrested the usual progress of decomposition,
prevented the escape of the hydrogen and other gaseous
elements, and gave rise to the bituminous fermentation by
which they were converted into lignite and coal; and we
have no proof that, had grasses been associated with the
ferns, they would not have undergone a similar change.
Moreover, there are countries in which the ferns now assume
the numerical proportion of the grasses of other latitudes;
for example. New Zealand, which also presents in its fauna a
striking analogy to that of the carboniferous deposits, in the
almost entire absence of indigenous mammalia; one species
of Rat being the only known living quadruped.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_187" id="Footnote_187"></a><a href="#FNanchor_187"><span class="label">[187]</span></a> See Mr. Morris's Catalogue of British Fossils.</p></div>

<p>On this subject Dr. Dieffenbach remarks, that "although
in its flora New Zealand has some relationship with the
two large continents between which it is situated, America
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211"> 211 </a></span>
and Australia, and even possesses some species identical with
those of Europe, without the Latter being referable to an introduction
by Europeans, yet the greater number of species,
and even genera, are peculiar to it. New Zealand, with the
adjacent islands, Chatham, Auckland, and Macquarrie, forms
a botanical centre. It is sufficiently distant from both continents
to preserve its botanical peculiarities, and it offers
the most striking instance of an acknowledged fact in all
branches of natural history, viz. that the different regions of
the globe are endowed with peculiar forms of animal and
vegetable life. The number of species of plants at present
known is 632, of which 314 are dicotyledonous, and the
rest, or 318, are monocotyledonous and cellular. The monocotyledons
are few in comparison with the cellular plants,
for there are but seventy-six species. The grasses have given
way to ferns, for the ferns and fern-like plants are by far the
most abundant in New Zealand, and cover immense districts.
They <i>replace the Gramine&aelig;</i> of other countries, and give a
character to all the open land of the hills and plains. Some
of the arborescent kinds grow to thirty feet and more in
height, and the variety and elegance of their forms, from the
minutest species to the most gigantic, are very remarkable."<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
In the accumulations of vegetable matter now in the progress
of formation in the morasses, bays, and creeks of New
Zealand, the remains of ferns largely predominate; and I am
informed by my son,<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> that in the estuaries they are associated
with numerous shells of brachiopodous mollusca.</p>

<p>From what has been advanced, the student will perceive
that to obtain an illustrative collection of the fossil plants of
Great Britain, many different localities must be visited.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"> 212 </a></span></p>

<p>The fruits and stems of Palms, Conifers, and many dicotyledons,
may be collected in the Isle of Sheppey, and other
places where the London Clay is exposed. (See <i>Excursion
to the Isle of Sheppey</i>, Part IV.) Cycadeous stems and
coniferous wood may be procured in the Isle of Portland;
from the Wealden Cliffs along the southern shore of the
Isle of Wight; and on the Sussex coast, from Bexhill, by
St. Leonard's, to the east of Hastings. The foliage of several
species of Zami&aelig; and ferns, occur abundantly in the lower
Oolite, along the Yorkshire coast, near Scarborough, and at
Gristhorpe Bay. The Lias of Lyme Regis, Charmouth, and
their vicinity, affords stems and branches of coniferous trees,
and leaves of cycads.</p>

<p>Ferns, Sigillari&aelig;, Calamites, and the usual plants of the
carboniferous flora, may be found in every coal-mine; and
the Devonian limestones of the South of Ireland yield ferns
and Lepidodendra. In Forfarshire the lower Devonian shales
abound in the foliage of aquatic, apparently fluviatile, plants.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_190" id="Footnote_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_190"><span class="label">[190]</span></a> See Memoir on the <span class="smcap">Telerpeton</span>; Geol. Journ. vol. viii. p. 106.</p></div>

<p>A list of some of the most productive British localities is
subjoined.</p>

<p>In addition to the suggestions already given as to the
mode of collecting specimens, it may be necessary to state
that the leaves in the tertiary marls and clays are generally
very delicate and friable, and liable to flake off in the state
of a carbonaceous film. This may, in a great measure, be
prevented by carefully covering them with a thin coating
either of mastic varnish, or gum-water, before they are
placed in the cabinet. In extracting these specimens, a
broad chisel will be found the most convenient instrument.
In searching for fossils in coal-mines, the collector should
remember that the ironstone nodules often contain beautiful
examples of the leaves of ferns, and fruits of Lepidodendra.
These nodules, when of an oblong shape, should be split open
in a longitudinal direction, by a smart blow of a hammer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"> 213 </a></span>
and the inclosed leaf will thus be exposed, as shown in

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL ZOOPHYTES.&mdash;PORIFERA OR AMORPHOZOA&mdash;POLYPIFERA OR
CORALS&mdash;BRYOZOA OR MOLLUSCAN ZOOPHYTES.</p>


<p>Many tribes of the extraordinary beings whose mineralized
relics are the immediate subject of our investigation, have
largely contributed to the solid materials of which the sedimentary
strata are composed. In the most ancient rocks
in which vestiges of organic structures have been detected,
those of <i>Zoophytes</i> hold a conspicuous place; and in the
seas of tropical climates, the agency of the Coral-animalcules,
or Polypifera, is producing enormous deposits, and laying the
foundations of new islands and continents, and forming reefs
of rocks hundreds of miles in extent, which, if elevated above
the level of the sea, would rival in magnitude the mountain-chains
of modern Europe.</p>

<p>The reader unacquainted with the natural history of these
marvellous creatures will find an account of their nature and
economy, and of the physical effects produced on the earth's
surface by their agency, in the sixth lecture of <i>Wond.</i> vol. ii.
p. 588.</p>

<p>The term Zoophytes, or animal-plants, comprises two very
distinct classes of living beings, namely, the <span class="smcap">Porifera</span>, or
Sponges, which (if not vegetables) are wanting in many attributes
regarded as essential characteristics of the members of
the animal kingdom; and the <span class="smcap">Polypifera</span>, or polype-bearing-animals,&mdash;the
Corals; which are generally associated groups
or aggregations of individuals, united by a common organized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"> 219 </a></span>
mass or axis, each polype having an independent existence,
and exhibiting volition and perception, in a greater or
lesser degree.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Fossil Porifera.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PORIFERA.</div>

<p>The terms <i>Amorphozoa</i> (signifying animals of variable
shapes), and <i>Porifera</i> (structures traversed by pores or channels),
are employed by naturalists to designate the Sponges
and analogous organisms, which appear to occupy the boundary
line that separates the animal from the vegetable
kingdom. The true position of the Sponges in the great
system of Creation is still a disputed point; for while many
distinguished naturalists regard them as <i>Protozoa</i>, or the
lowest type of animal organization, others of equal eminence
affirm that neither in structure nor functions do they differ
from vegetables in any essential particular; and that if a
line be drawn between the two kingdoms the Porifera must
be placed on the vegetable side of the boundary. On the
other hand, Dr. George Johnston, in his delightful work on
the British Zoophytes,<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> expresses his opinion that there
is nothing to discountenance the belief that these bodies
hold an intermediate place; that they are, in fact, the true
<i>Zoophytes</i>, or animal-plants; in some forms, as the green
<i>Spongill&aelig;</i> of our lakes, the vegetable nature prevails; while
in others, as the horny or keratose sponges filled with mucilaginous
slime, and the fleshy <i>Tethya</i> whose oscula, or pores,
are said to exhibit signs of irritability, the animal character
predominates.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_193" id="Footnote_193"></a><a href="#FNanchor_193"><span class="label">[193]</span></a> A History of British Sponges, &amp;c. by Dr. George Johnston, Edinburgh.
1843. One vol. 8vo. with twenty-five plates. A previous
work, "A History of British Zoophytes," with forty-four plates, from
drawings by the accomplished lady of the Author, cannot be too
highly commended.</p></div>

<p>Without committing ourselves to either opinion, and
simply remarking that the large proportion of silex that
enters into the tissues of a considerable number of the porifera,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"> 220 </a></span>
is more characteristic of vegetable than of animal structures,
we proceed to consider the fossil sponges and allied forms,
as the mineralized remains of the lowest types of the animal
kingdom: if the vegetable nature of the originals were generally
admitted, this section should have followed that which
treats of the Diatomace&aelig; (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>.).</p>

<p>Sponge consists of a reticulated fibrous mass, covered with
numerous pores of various sizes, which are connected internally
by anastomosing channels, and this tissue is surrounded
by a cellular gelatinous matter, by which the entire structure
was secreted, and is, in fact, the vital part of the zoophyte.
The tough framework or skeleton is in some kinds fibrous,
horny, flexible, or rigid, and strengthened by calcareous or
siliceous spicula (<i>spines</i>);<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> while in other species its substance
is calcareous, and in some siliceous, constituting a web of
transparent rock crystal, resembling spun glass,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> The gelatinous
matter lines all the cavities, and forms the margins of
the openings; it presents no signs of irritability, and may be
easily pressed out of the porous mass with the hand, so
slight is the connexion between the skeleton and the investing
tissue. Currents of water constantly enter the small
pores, traverse the inosculating canals, and issue from the
larger orifices, which often project above the surface in perforated
papill&aelig;. By the circulation of the water through
the porous structure, the nutrition of the organized mass is
effected; and the modifications observable in the number,
size, form, and disposition of the pores, channels, and orifices,
in different species, appear to be subservient to this especial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"> 221 </a></span>
purpose; the imbibition and expulsion of water being the
only function the sponges perform. In its earliest stage the
sponge gemmule is of a spheroidal shape, and covered with
vibratile cilia, and after expulsion from the canals in which
it is formed, moves rapidly through the water till it becomes
attached to some body, and is then immovably fixed during
life; exhibiting no signs of vitality save the aqueous circulation
through the pores and canals.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_194" id="Footnote_194"></a><a href="#FNanchor_194"><span class="label">[194]</span></a> The Mediterranean and American sponges of commerce are devoid
of spicules, and are deprived of their soft animal matter simply by
washing freely in fresh water.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_195" id="Footnote_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_195"><span class="label">[195]</span></a> I particularly allude to a siliceous Sponge from Barbadoes, named,
by Mr. Samuel Stutchbury, formerly of the Bristol Institution, (now of
Australia.) <i>Dictyochalix pumicea</i>. This specimen is of a fungiform
shape, and appears to the naked eye as if formed of pumice stone, but
under the microscope is literally a tissue of transparent silex.</p></div>

<p>There is much confusion in the arrangement and nomenclature
of the fossil species of this class of zoophytes; and
this has originated, in part, from the varied forms assumed
by the same species, having been described under different
names; and from the reprehensible practice of changing,
without sufficient reason, the name assigned to a species by
the original discoverer; an evil, unfortunately, not restricted
to this department of natural history.</p>

<p>The recent Sponges are arranged in four groups according
to their structure, viz.&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fresh-water Sponges.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spongilla</span>: siliceous spicula in a translucent jelly-like mass.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Marine Sponges.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tethea</span>: having a tough outer skin; siliceous spicula in
bundles, and radiating from the compact nucleus to the
periphery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Halichondria</span>: (from <i>silex</i> and <i>cartilago</i>) siliceous spicula
in a cartilaginous mass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grantia</span>: calcareous spicula in a gelatinous mass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL SPONGES.</div>

<p>M. D'Orbigny seems to believe that with the exception of
the horny <i>Cliona</i>, all the fossil sponges had originally calcareous
skeletons,&mdash;"qu'ils n'ont jamais &eacute;t&eacute; corn&eacute;s, mais que
leur tissu a toujours &eacute;t&eacute; calcaire et pierreuse;"<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> which is certainly
not the case, for abundant examples of fossil keratose
sponges occur.</p>

<p>I have selected a few genera for the illustration of the
subject, and shall describe them under the names that are
most familiar to the British scientific collector: doubtless
sooner or later some competent naturalist will undertake the
elucidation of this department of pal&aelig;ontology, and construct
a classification and nomenclature based on natural characters;
till then the student will find it hopeless to attempt to learn
the ever-varying names of genera and species applied to
fossil Porifera and Polypifera, by different observers.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

in the late Mr. Dixon's beautiful work on Chalk and Tertiary
Fossils, and Mr. Milne Edwards in his able Monograph in the Pal&aelig;ontological
Society's Memoirs, have described many of our chalk Corals
under different specific and generic names.</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">SPONGITES IN CHALK AND FLINT.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On the Sponges in Chalk and Flint.</span>&mdash;From the durability
of the tissue of the flexible sponges, and the imperishable
nature of those which have a siliceous or calcareous endo-skeleton
or framework, their fossil remains generally occur
in a fine state of preservation, and in immense quantities, in
the sediments that were deposited in those parts of the
ancient sea-bottoms, originally inhabited by these zoophytes.
Even the relics of the keratose species, the <i>Halichondria</i>,
whose structure consists of siliceous spines imbedded in a
cartilaginous mass, are equally abundant. Sponge-spicula
are everywhere met with in the chalk, flint, and greensand,
and many layers in the cretaceous strata are almost entirely
composed of them.</p>

<p>Sponges so commonly form the nuclei of the nodular flints,
that some naturalists have ascribed the formation of the
layers and nodules of silex in the cretaceous rocks to these
zoophytes: a supposition altogether groundless,<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> The various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"> 223 </a></span>
states of mineralization in which sponges occur in the chalk
give rise to many beautiful and highly instructive fossils, as
we shall point out in the course of this notice. In general
the zoophyte is simply invested by the flint, the pores and
tubes being filled with silex, the original tissue appearing as
a brown reticulated calcareous mass. In other examples the
sponge has been permeated by the liquid flint, and subsequently
perished; and in this manner have been formed
those hollow nodules which on being broken are found to
contain only a powder, consisting of siliceous spicules and
fragments of silicified sponge. But in numerous instances
the substance of the zoophyte is completely silicified, and
the intimate structure of the original exquisitely preserved;
such are many of the flint-pebbles, and moss-agates, that
are mounted as brooches and other ornaments.</p>

in a Memoir entitled Notes of a Microscopical Examination of

<p><span class="smcap">Spongites.</span><a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>&mdash;This name I would apply generically to
those fossils which appear to be identical in structure with
the ordinary marine sponges that consist of a fibro-reticulated
porous mass, destitute of regular tubes or canals: the form
exceedingly various.</p>

<p>The fossil sponges of the chalk may be divided into two
groups; the cyathiforms, or cup-shaped, and the ramose, or
branched. Flints inclosing the first kind, generally exhibit
externally the form of the original; those containing the
branched species are of irregular shapes, and except by an
experienced observer, the nature of the enclosed body would
not be suspected. On breaking them, the sponge is often
well displayed, as in the specimen figured in <a href="#lign_69"><i>Lign.</i> 69, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>:
the surface of this fossil was covered with a white gritty
powder, made up of minute needle-shaped siliceous spicula.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SPONGITES IN FLINTS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Spongites Ramosus.</span>&mdash;A branched sponge, sometimes from
twelve to fifteen inches long, is not uncommon in the flints
of the Lewes and Brighton chalk; the stems and branches
are cylindrical, and the terminations of the latter are rounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"> 224 </a></span>
and full of large pores. When completely silicified the structure
can only be detected by fracture, but occasionally the
sponge appears to have been saturated with liquid chalk
before it was enveloped in the flint; and as it is coated with
calcareous matter, it may be detached from the nodule
entire.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Spongites Townsendi.</span> (<i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. xli.)&mdash;The cyathiform
flints, whose shape depends on the inclosed zoophytes,
so much resemble the cup-shaped sponges of commerce, as
to be easily recognized in the heaps of nodules that are
collected in chalk districts for the roads; they are from one
to eight inches in diameter at the upper part, and many
are of a globular or spheroidal shape; the surface has the
usual calcareo-siliceous coating of flint nodules, giving a
sensation of roughness to the touch; the margin of the cup
generally exhibits a narrow band of porous structure, and when
broken, sections of the enclosed body are exposed. These
funnel-shaped spongites terminate at the bottom in a peduncle,
whence fibrous root-like processes diverge; by these
appendages the original was fixed to the rock. I have collected
a few specimens in which the roots are attached to a
shell, or pebble, but have never seen any that appeared to
occupy the spot on which they grew. They seem to have
been detached from their native sites by the waves, and
transported to a distance, and subsiding into the tranquil
depths of the ocean, became imbedded in the cretaceous
sediments that were accumulating at the bottom.</p>

abundant species of amorphozoa has given rise to sub-hemispherical
flints, rounded below and flat above, with a
marginal band of porous tissue, that expands into flexuous
lobes which fill up the area of the upper surface. When
found imbedded in the chalk, the form of this zoophyte is
often preserved entire; the upper part showing the lobated
and flexuous character of the original. Upon breaking these
flints, the organic structure is generally apparent; but in
many instances has perished, and left a cavity which is either
partially filled with stalactitical chalcedony, or lined with
quartz crystals. These fossils vary in size from a walnut to
that of an orange; the pedicle has long processes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Siphonia.</span> <a href="#lign_73"><i>Lign.</i> 73.</a>&mdash;These fossil porifera are readily
distinguished from those which have engaged our attention
by their more symmetrical structure. The body of the
zoophyte is a mass of dense porous tissue, of a pyriform or
bulbous shape, supported by a slender stem fixed at the base
by rootlets. The stem is composed of very fine parallel longitudinal
tubes, which extend to a series of canals that traverse
the mass, and terminate in openings on the surface of a
shallow central cavity, as shown in the section, <a href="#lign_73"><i>fig. 2, Lign. 73</i></a>.
The characters of this genus are well exemplified in a common
species of the Greensand (<i>S. pyriformis</i>, <a href="#lign_73"><i>Lign. 73</i></a>),
described by the late Mr. Webster, from specimens collected
in the Isle of Wight, where it occurs in profusion, near
Ventnor, and the Western lines. This zoophyte is pyriform,
(<a href="#lign_73"><i>Lign. 73, fig. 1</i></a>,) and has a shallow cylindrical cavity, supported
upon a long slender stem, the base of which is fixed
by root-like processes (<i>fig. 5</i>); the transverse fracture shows
a section of the longitudinal tubes. This species has been
found in numerous localities of the Greensand, and also in
the Firestone or malm-rock.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>The Kentish rag contains
irregular ramose spongeous
bodies, which belong to this
group of porifera; and Mr.
Bensted has discovered in his
quarry, near Maidstone, numerous
remains of a polymorphous
lobed zoophyte, having
a porous structure beset with
spicula. In the Firestone of
Southbourne, Steyning, and
Bignor, in Sussex, I have observed
large pyriform and subcylindrical Siphoni&aelig;.</p>

<p>The organization of all these zoophytes was evidently
adapted for the imbibition and circulation of sea-water, in a
more perfect and definite manner than in the irregular simple
sponges.</p>

<p>Flint-pebbles inclosing remains of Siphoni&aelig; abound on
the Sussex coast, especially in the shingle near Brighton,
having been washed out of the chalk cliffs. There were
several chalk-pits in Edward-street, (now, I believe, filled
up and the area built upon,) in which every flint enveloped
a sponge or siphonia; many specimens were mineralized by
pyrites and beautifully exhibited the internal structure of
the originals.</p>

<p>Siphoni&aelig; (chiefly <i>S. pyriformis</i>) are abundant in the
Upper Greensand, near Farnham in Surrey, but their tissues
are saturated with phosphate of lime, instead of silica as is
ordinarily the case; the entire sponge usually contains between
50 and 60 per cent, of phosphate: hence these fossils
have, of late, been in great request for manure.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Choanites K&ouml;nigi</span>, <a href="#lign_75"><i>Lign. 75.</i></a>&mdash;The zoophyte which has

Choanites,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> is of a spheroidal or sub-ovate form, and appears
to have been composed of a softer tissue than the ordinary
sponges. It has a central cavity, and was fixed at the base
by long rootlets: its mass is traversed by numerous tubes or
channels, which open on the inner surface of the cavity; it
differs from Siphonia in not having a stem composed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"> 234 </a></span>
bundles of tubes, and probably also in its constituent substance.
Among the Sussex and Wiltshire chalk-flints specimens
of this zoophyte are very common; they are easily
recognized by the peculiar markings produced by the silicified
tubes that radiate from the centre, as seen in <a href="#lign_75"><i>Lign. 75, fig. 4</i></a>.
The semi-diaphanous pebbles on the Sussex coast, more frequently
contain Choanites than any other zoophytes. From
the beautiful and varied markings observable in the polished
sections, they are in great request for brooches, and are
termed <i>petrified sea-animal flowers</i><a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> by the lapidaries; among

<p><i>Lign. 75, fig. 4</i>, represents the usual appearance of a flint
deriving its form from a Choanite; <i>fig. 2</i>, is the upper part
of a Choanite preserved in chalk, and richly coloured by
iron; the opening at the summit, <i>a</i>, is the orifice of the
central cylindrical cavity, which is in this instance filled up
by chalk, but in flint specimens, with silex of a different
colour to that of the surrounding mass. If <i>fig. 2</i>, were
placed on the top of <i>fig. 4</i>, the general shape of the original
zoophyte would be represented. The opening at the base
of <i>fig. 4</i>, marks the spot whence the processes of attachment
proceeded. The vertical section of a flint, similar to <i>fig.</i> 4,
is shown at <i>fig. 3</i>; and in this example are seen the central
cavity, and a section of the substance of the zoophyte, which
is traversed by numerous tubes, that ramify through the
mass of which the body was composed, and terminate in
openings on the inner wall of the central cavity, or sac. A
transverse section of a similar flint is delineated in <i>fig. 1</i>; the
central white spot indicates the sac filled with flint, and the
tubes are seen radiating from it through the mass; under a
powerful lens the interstitial structure appears to be granular
rather than porous. The perfect transparency of the body
when silicified, and the rich tints it has acquired from metallic
solutions, and the compressed state in which it is often
found, seem to indicate that the original mass was a soft
gelatinous substance, like that of the <i>Actinia</i>, strengthened
by spicula; for numerous tri-radiate spines, like those on
the left-hand of <a href="#lign_75"><i>fig. 5, Lign. 75</i></a>, occur occasionally in chalk
specimens.</p>

central cavity, large oval spots, that are sections of a canal
which traverses the entire mass, proceeding from the base
to the summit, in a spiral coil around the central cavity.
This structure was first detected by Mr. Cunnington. Mr.
Woodward thinks this spiral tube is common to all the
Choanites, and constitutes a generic character; but so many
examples have passed under my examination in which no
traces of such a canal are perceptible, that it may be a
specific difference.</p>

<p>Among the chalk amorphozoa whose true affinities are
doubtful, is a small turbinated zoophyte, which I would
place provisionally under this genus; it has a shallow central
cavity, with a broad smooth margin, a reticulated external
surface, and radicle processes proceeding from the base; see
<a href="#lign_80"><i>Lign. 80, fig. 1</i></a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PARAMOUDRA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Paramoudra.</span> <a href="#lign_76"><i>Lign. 76.</i></a>&mdash;This vernacular Irish term was
introduced by Dr. Buckland, in his account of some gigantic
flints, thus popularly named, that occur in the chalk near
Belfast, and also at Whitlingham, near Norwich. These
fossils are of an irregular, oblong, spherical, or pyriform
shape, having a cavity above, which, in some specimens,
extends to the bottom; indications of a pedicle are seen at
the base; in short, they closely resemble, upon a large scale,
the funnel-shaped spongites, so frequent in the flints of the
South Downs. Their appearance <i>in situ</i>, is represented
<a href="#lign_76"><i>Lign. 76</i></a>, from Dr. Buckland's illustrations: <i>b</i>, is a single
specimen, partly imbedded in the chalk, and <i>c</i>, <i>d</i>, two of the
fossils in contact, the pedicle of the upper one lying in the
cavity of the lower.</p>

<p>These bodies are from one to two or more feet in length,
and from six inches to a foot in diameter. The appearance,
both of the outer and inner surface, is that of the usual
white calcareo-siliceous crust of spongitic chalk-flints. Upon
breaking them, no decided structure is perceptible; but here
and there, patches of red and blue chalcedony occur, as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"> 237 </a></span>
the Ventriculites and spongites in chalk-flints; the originals
were probably large goblet-shaped zoophytes, allied to the
sponges, but of so perishable a nature as to leave but few
traces of their organization, save their general form. Specimens
may however yet be found with the structure preserved,
for many years elapsed after the first discovery of
flint ventriculites, before I obtained examples that threw
light on their origin and formation.</p>

(first described by Dr. Grant under the name of <i>Cliona</i>),
consisting of a fleshy substance, full of siliceous tubular pin-shaped
spicula, gives rise to those perforations with which
oysters and other shells are often completely riddled,<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Certain

sponge having subsequently been filled up by flint, a curious
series of fossil bodies has resulted, which we shall more particularly
notice hereafter. These fossils Mr. Morris has
distinguished by the name <i>Clionites</i>, to indicate their origin;
they are not, however, the silicified sponge, but inorganic
casts, moulded in the excavations. The common species is
<i>C. Conybearei</i>: "cells irregular, somewhat polygonal, with

<p>Spicula, or spines of Porifera. <a href="#lign_75"><i>Lign. 75.</i></a>&mdash;Siliceous
spicules, as we have had occasion to mention, occur in
immense quantities in some of those deposits which abound
in the remains of spongites. These spines are tubular, and
of various shapes; some are acicular, or needle-like; others
of a stellate form; many are tri-radiate or multi-radiate; and
some have the shape of a trident; a few of these fossils are
figured in <a href="#lign_75"><i>Lign. 75</i></a>. As the <i>Actinia</i>, <i>Gorgonia</i>, and <i>Alcyonia</i>,
possess spicula, some of the fossil spines may have been
derived from those zoophytes. The larger spicules may be

<p><span class="smcap">Spiniferites</span> (<i>Xanthidium</i>, Ehrenb.). <a href="#lign_77"><i>Lign.</i> 77.</a>&mdash;I propose
to describe in this place those elegant and very minute
bodies, that occur in great numbers in the chalk and flint,
and which, on the authority of M. Ehrenberg, were regarded
as identical with the siliceous frustules of the genus of fresh-water
Desmidi&aelig;, named <i>Xanthidium</i><a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_91">p. 91</a>.) Later
and more correct observations have proved that the fossils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"> 240 </a></span>
under consideration entirely differ from their supposed homologues;
their original substance not being siliceous, but
flexible and membranous; and that instead of being spores
of alg&aelig;, they are probably the gemmules either of porifera,
or of polypifera.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_218" id="Footnote_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_218"><span class="label">[218]</span></a> Several recent species of Xanthidium are figured in <i>Plate IV.</i> of
this volume.</p></div>

<p>To avoid the perpetuation of the error by the retention
of the botanical name of a recent genus of plants, for
fossils whose vegetable origin is very problematical, and
which are entirely distinct from their supposed analogues,
I would substitute that of Spiniferites,<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> a term simply
expressive of the general aspect of these bodies; that of a
globe or sphere beset with spines. The appearance of these
fossils will be understood by the examination of a group
discovered by Mr. Reginald Neville Mantell, in a fragment
chipped off from a flint pebble; and I will describe the mode
by which these minute objects were detected, as it offers a
good practical lesson for the young investigator.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The chip of flint is represented, of the natural size, in
<a href="#lign_77"><i>Lign. 77, fig. 1</i></a>; it was immersed in oil of turpentine for a
short time, and then placed on a piece of glass, and examined
with a moderate power, by transmitted light, the turpentine
having rendered the translucent flint almost as transparent
as glass; this appearance is shown in <i>fig.</i> 2; the organisms
here represented are from <sup>1</sup>/<sub>300</sub> to <sup>1</sup>/<sub>500</sub> of an inch in diameter.
The half-inch object-glass was next employed, and <i>fig.</i> 3
gives the result. The quarter-inch object-glass, and a corresponding
eye-piece, were then substituted, and by the
adaptation of a camera lucida, <i>figs.</i> 4, 5, and 6, were delineated.
As <i>fig.</i> 5 proved to be a new species, it was named
after its discoverer.</p>

<p>The specimens in flint, when rendered transparent and
viewed by transmitted light under a high power, as shown
in <i>Lign.</i> <a href="#lign_78">78</a>, and <a href="#lign_79">79</a>, appear as hollow globular bodies, beset
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"> 241 </a></span>
with spinous processes, which in most species are fimbriated
at the extremities. There is considerable
variety in the form and length
of the spines. In <i>S. Reginaldi</i>, these
appendages are numerous, regular,
short, and relatively thick: in an
elegant species discovered by the Rev.
J. B. Reade (<a href="#lign_79"><i>Lign.</i> 79</a>) they are long
and palmated: in other kinds they
are of intermediate size and proportions.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The apparently torn and collapsed
state of the body and arms of some examples first led me
to doubt the siliceous nature of the original substance; and
on my discovery of the soft
parts of foraminifera in flint
and chalk, Mr. Deane undertook
to search for the so-called
Xanthidia in chalk, that these
bodies might be subjected to
chemical analysis,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Mr. Deane
succeeded in detecting all the
usual species in the Dover
chalk, by digesting some chalk
in dilute hydrochloric acid,
and mounting the residue in
Canada balsam. In this state
the shape of the body is that
of a depressed sphere; many
of the specimens appear to have a circular opening, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"> 242 </a></span>
arms or spines to be closed at the extremities. Upon pressure
under water between two pieces of glass, they were torn
asunder as a horny or cartilaginous substance would be, and
the spines in contact with the glass were bent. Some after
maceration in water several weeks became flaccid; a proof
that they are not siliceous.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p>

<p>The real nature of these fossils must be regarded as still
undetermined: their prevalence in the chalk-flints whose
forms are derived from zoophytes, seems to countenance the
supposition that the Spiniferites are the gemmules or early
state of animals of this family; but I have never detected
any organic connexion between them and the porifera with
which they are associated; it is possible they may be the
germs of the remarkable zoophytes we have next to examine.</p>

the conflicting opinions entertained by naturalists, respecting
some of the most abundant of the extinct forms; arising
from the imperfect state of our knowledge as to the structure
of the originals, which compels a comparison with recent
types, from which, perhaps, the fossils differed essentially in
their organization. This remark especially applies to the
zoophytes which have given rise to the fungiform flints so
well known to the inhabitants of the chalk districts of
Sussex, as "<i>petrified mushrooms</i>," from their close resemblance
in form to fungi: a specimen with this name inscribed

<p>These specimens demonstrate that all the flints referred to,
have been moulded in the cavities of cyathiform zoophytes;
and that their diversity of figure has arisen from the amount
of silex that happened to permeate the organism; if but a
small proportion of silica in solution was present, then flints,
like <i>fig.</i> 4, were produced; if the quantity were sufficient
to fill up a considerable part of the tissues of the original,
fungiform flints, as <a href="#lign_80"><i>Lign. 80, fig. 3</i></a>, and <a href="#lign_81"><i>Lign. 81, fig. 3</i></a>, were
the result. The disciform flints originated from the expanded

was insufficient to silicify the entire zoophyte, an annular

<p>The form of the original was evidently that of a hollow
inverted cone, terminating in a point at the base, which
was attached by fibrous rootlets to other bodies. The outer
integument was reticulated, that is, disposed in meshes, like
net-work; and the inner surface studded with regular openings,
apparently the orifices of tubular cells. The substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"> 246 </a></span>
of the mass appears to have been sufficiently flexible to expand
and contract without laceration. This opinion is based
on the fact, that in many specimens the zoophyte is a nearly
flat circular disc (<a href="#lign_81"><i>Lign. 81, figs. 1, 2</i></a>); and in others a subcylindrical
pouch. In the former state the outer reticulated
structure is elongated, while in the latter, it is corrugated;
hence I am led to conclude that the original possessed a
common irritability, and was able to contract and expand
like many of the flexible polypiaria. The openings on the
inner surface are cylindrical, and very regular; the flints
often present sharp casts of them, which appear like rows
of minute pillars. When the flint filling up the cavity of
a Ventriculite can be extracted, it is a solid cone, studded
with papill&aelig;, the casts of the cells, as in <a href="#lign_82"><i>Lign. 82, fig. 4</i></a>.</p>

<p>In the flints, the substance of the Ventriculites is generally
as translucent as that of the Choanites, and defined by
its rich purple, sienna, or grey colour;<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> but towards the
base and margin it is more or less calcareous; and in many
examples the whole, or a large portion of the zoophyte, is in
this state. But this fact does not invalidate the inference
that the original was flexible; for in these instances the
tissues may have been immersed in fluid chalk before their
envelopment in flint,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The chalk specimens are commonly
as friable and earthy as the surrounding stone, from which
they are distinguishable by their ochreous colour.</p>

white limestone is uncoloured, may be explained by the
chemical changes to which the decomposition of animal
matter under such circumstances would give rise. If sulphuretted
hydrogen were evolved from the putrifying zoophytes
imbedded in calcareous mud containing iron in solution, the
sulphur would enter into combination with the iron, the
hydrogen escape, and a sulphate or sulphuret of iron be
deposited, atom by atom, and thus impart colour and permanence
of form to the original.</p>

<p>When the inclosed organisms in the flint nodules have
perished, chalcedony, quartz crystals, or crystallized pyrites,
sometimes of great beauty, are found occupying the cavities;
in short, numerous modifications of the petrifactive process
are beautifully exhibited in these common, but highly interesting,
cretaceous fossils.</p>

<p>The species to which the previous remarks more immediately
refer, is named <i>Ventriculites radiatus</i>; from the radiated
appearance of the external integument; some of the

<p><span class="smcap">Ventriculites alcyonoides.</span> <a href="#lign_83"><i>Lign. 83.</i></a>&mdash;Under the name
of "<i>Ocellaria inclusa</i>," the late Mr. K&ouml;nig<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> figured and described
an elegant fossil zoophyte not uncommon in the
chalk and flints of Sussex. This fossil is inversely conical,
and somewhat resembles the cast of the cavity of <i>Ventriculites
radiatus</i>, but a little attention will enable the collector to
distinguish it. The flint that is moulded in <i>V. radiatus</i>, is
surrounded by the substance of the zoophyte, and if found
detached, with the investing material removed, shows no structure
whatever, but simply a surface covered with minute
papill&aelig;. The present zoophyte is generally included in a
nodule, and by a slight blow may be readily separated from
the surrounding flint; it then has the appearance of a white
calcareous cone, beset with regular cells, disposed in quincunx
order (<a href="#lign_83"><i>Lign. 83, fig. 2</i></a>); leaving a conical cavity in the flint,
which is covered with corresponding eminences (<a href="#lign_83"><i>Lign. 83,
fig. 4</i></a>). Upon breaking the cone itself, it is found to consist
of a dense reticulated structure, from one-eighth to a
quarter of an inch in thickness (<a href="#lign_83"><i>Lign. 83, fig. 2a</i></a>), investing
a solid nucleus of flint, the surface of the latter being
covered with minute points, which are less regular than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"> 249 </a></span>
those on the cavity of the outer case. The specific name,
<i>inclusa</i>, was suggested by this character; which, however, is
only accidental, for the specimens imbedded in chalk, are
simply surrounded by the stone. It is the calcareous nature
of the fossil, which renders it so easily separable from the investing
flint, while its cells afford numerous points of attachment,
and these remain as casts in relief on the interior of
the hollow case: I have not observed the same regularity of
structure on the inner as on the outer surface.</p>

<p>The reticulated integument of this zoophyte resembles in
structure that of <i>V. radiatus</i>. With regard to the latter,
I should state that Mr. Toulmin Smith<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> discovered that the
inosculating fibres of the intimate tissue formed an octahedral
plexus at each knot or point of union; and this structure
Mr. Smith regards as peculiar to the Ventriculites, and
states that he detected it in all the fossils he has arranged
under the name <i>Ventriculid&aelig;</i>. No spicula have been detected
in the integuments.</p>

Annals of Natural History, with many figures of cretaceous zoophytes.
By Toulmin Smith, Esq.</p></div>

<p>Until more ample and satisfactory evidence is collected as
to the nature of these fossils, the interests of science will
be best promoted by allowing the question to remain sub
judice, and restricting the term Ventriculites to those zoophytes
which possess the general characters of the type to
which the name was originally assigned; namely, a vasiform
or subcylindrical framework, terminating at the base in a
point, and fixed by radicle processes; the substance consisting
of a plexiform fibrous tissue; externally constituting a
reticulated integument, the meshes disposed in a radiating
manner from the base to the periphery; the inner surface
studded with open cells regularly arranged.</p>

<p>In the former edition of this work the Ventriculites were
placed with the Polypifera from the structure of the openings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"> 250 </a></span>
or cells, for these are so symmetrical, and disposed with
so much regularity, as to present a closer analogy to the
polype-cells of a coral, than to the large pores of a sponge.
The doubts expressed by many eminent observers as to the
correctness of this view, have induced me to insert this notice
in the present section; leaving the true affinities of these
organisms to be determined by future observers. Possibly
we have in these fossils the relics of a tribe of zoophytes of
an extinct type, that formed a connecting link between the
<i>porifera</i> and the <i>polypifera</i>; however this may be, I will
venture to affirm that no one who had seen the infinitely
varied examples of these fossils that I have, would for a
moment confound them, as some naturalists have done, with
the Scyphi&aelig;, and other simple amorphozoa.</p>

here notice an exceedingly minute and
interesting object, discovered by the
Rev. J. B. Reade, in a flint containing
vestiges of a Ventriculite, and which
may possibly belong to this tribe of
zoophytes. It must however be remarked,
that there was nothing to show
the collocation was not accidental. The
drawing with which Mr. Reade favoured
me, is engraved <a href="#lign_84"><i>Lign. 84</i></a>. This object
is unmistakeably a polype-cell, with
some of the integument of the animal
protruding, in the form of a shrivelled
tube. The possibility of soft animal
tissues being preserved in flint, will not
now admit of question, as we shall show
when treating of the Foraminifera. The record of this fact
may load to the discovery of other fossils of a like nature.</p>

<p>As we proceed in our investigations, the impossibility of
rigidly adhering to a zoological classification based on the
structure of organs, of which but few, if any, traces exist in
the mineral kingdom, becomes more and more apparent; the
durable skeletons or polyparia being the only materials from
which the pal&aelig;ontologist can gather information, relating to
the physiology of the extinct coral-animals which swarmed
in the ancient seas, and whose petrified remains constitute
a large proportion of the secondary and pal&aelig;ozoic calcareous
rocks.</p>

<p>Numerous fossil genera have been established by various
authors from the external form of the polyparium, or the
disposition and structure of the cells; but a slight attention
to this department of pal&aelig;ontology will disclose corals which
differ essentially from the typical forms, and new genera and
species will require to be added to the already extended
catalogue. The few genera selected for the present work,
will convey a general idea of the nature of this class of
fossils. To ascertain the names of the species he may collect,
the student must refer to works especially devoted to the
illustration of the corals of particular rocks; as for example,
those of the British <i>Cretaceous</i> deposits in the monographs
of the Pal&aelig;ontological Society; of the <i>Pal&aelig;ozoic</i> in <i>Sil. Syst.</i>;
and in Prof Sedgwick's Synopsis of the Classification of the
Brit. Pal. Foss.; of the <i>Mountain Limestone</i> in Prof, Phillips's
work; and those of Ireland in Col. Portlock's Geological
Memoirs. Those of the pal&aelig;ozoic rocks of New York, are
illustrated in Prof. James Hall's splendid work on the Geology
of that State.</p>

<p>The fossil zoophytes included in this section present innumerable
varieties of form and structure, but agree in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"> 252 </a></span>
important character of having originated, (with but few exceptions,)
from aggregations of those minute beings termed
Polypes (many-feet<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>). The common Hydra (<i>Wond.</i> p. 600),
or fresh-water polype, that inhabits pools and streams, is a
familiar example of a free animal of this kind, consisting of
a cellular gelatinous substance, in the form of a short tube,
or pouch, surrounded at the upper margin by long tentacula,
or feelers, which appear to the naked eye as delicate threads.
The <i>Polypifera</i>, properly so called, are groups of polypes,
permanently united by a common integument or axis, each
animalcule having an independent existence. A common
support or endo-skeleton, termed <i>polyparium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> is secreted
by the integuments, which varies in its nature from a mere
gelatinous, or horny material, to an earthy, calcareous, and
even siliceous substance, that remains when the polypes die,
and their soft parts have perished. All the varieties of
corals, &amp;c. are nothing more than the durable structures of
aggregated masses of such beings.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_229" id="Footnote_229"></a><a href="#FNanchor_229"><span class="label">[229]</span></a> A name derived from the tentacula, or processes, which in some
species serve for prehension, and in others for respiration.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_230" id="Footnote_230"></a><a href="#FNanchor_230"><span class="label">[230]</span></a> The basis, framework, or endo-skeleton, of these groups of animalcules
is termed the <i>polyparium</i>, or <i>polypidom</i> (polype-habitation);
those of a stony hardness are familiarly known as corals; these
names, therefore, refer to the durable substance, and not to the
animals themselves; but in familiar writing, the term Coral is often
used to designate the entire living mass. The Red-Coral forms a
distinct genus called <i>Corallium</i>. In fossils, the <i>polyparium</i> alone
remains, except in very rare instances.</p></div>

<p>It may here be necessary to notice a prevailing error,
regarding the mode in which the substance called coral is
produced. It is very generally supposed that Corals, particularly
those bearing stars and cells, have been constructed
by animalcules, in the same manner as is the honey-comb,
by the Bee; and the expressions often employed by naturalists,
of "the coral animalcules building up their rocky
habitations," and "constructing their cells," have contributed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"> 253 </a></span>
to foster this error. But the processes are in no respect
similar: the insect, under the guidance of an unerring instinct,
resulting from its peculiar organization, <i>constructs</i> its
cells; but the polype is incapable of forming, or even modifying,
its support or cell in the slightest degree. The polypidom
is <i>secreted</i> by the animal tissues, in the same manner as are
the bones in the vertebrated animals, without the individual
being conscious of the process. If a piece of white coral be
immersed in dilute hydrochloric acid, the calcareous part is
dissolved, and the secreting membrane, in the form of a flocculent
substance, is seen attached to the undissolved part; even
in some coralline marbles of incalculable antiquity, the animal
membrane may, in this manner, be detected.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>From the delicate and perishable nature of many of the
gelatinous zoophytes, numerous tribes may have inhabited
the seas, which deposited the fossiliferous strata, and yet no
indications of their existence remain; while, of others, but
obscure traces of their structure are likely to be detected.</p>

<p>The Polypifera are separated into two natural groups or
classes; viz. the <span class="smcap">Anthozoa</span> (flower-animals), and the <span class="smcap">Bryozoa</span>
(moss-animals), or <span class="smcap">Polyzoa</span>.</p>

<p>The Anthozoa are polypes of the most simple type of
structure. The body consists of a symmetrical gelatinous
sac, capable of contraction and expansion, with one aperture
or mouth, which is encircled by tentacula. The Hydra, or
fresh-water polype (<i>Wond.</i> p. 600), is a familiar example of
a single, locomotive, anthozoan animal. In the compound
or aggregated forms, the body is either inclosed in a horny
sheath (ex. <i>Sertularia</i>, <i>Wond.</i> p. 615), or is supported by
a lamellated calcareous endo-skeleton (ex. <i>Fungia</i>, <i>Wond.</i>
p. 623, pl. vi. <i>fig.</i> 15), or the soft parts invest a stony axis
(ex. <i>Madrepora</i>, <i>Wond.</i> p. 620), or a horny flexible framework
(ex. <i>Gorgonia</i>, <i>Wond.</i> p. 616).</p>

<p>The Anthozoa are subdivided into three orders, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"> 254 </a></span>
based on the peculiar characters of the polypes; the <i>Hydra</i>,
the <i>Actinia</i> (Sea-Anemone, <i>Wond.</i> p. 622), and the <i>Alcyonium</i>
(Dead-men's fingers, <i>Wond.</i> pl. v. <i>fig.</i> 10), being
respectively the type of 1. the <i>Hydroida</i>, or Hydraform;
2. the <i>Asteroida</i> or Alcyonian; and 3. the <i>Helianthoida</i>, or
Actiniform zoophytes.</p>

<p>In the Hydroida the body in the compound species is
implanted in a horny tubular sheath, and the polypidoms
form branched corallines, which are fixed by the base to
rocks, sea-weeds, shells, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Asteroida have a horny or calcareous axis, surrounded
and inclosed by the soft parts which secrete it.</p>

<p>The Helianthoids, except in the simple free species, as the
Actinia, have a lamellated calcareous polypidom, the plates
of which radiate from a centre.</p>

<p>The calcareous secretions of the Anthozoa, especially of
the Helianthoida, in a great measure constitute the mass of
the coral-reefs and coral-islands of tropical seas. Their
polypidoms, whether external or internal, maintain but little
organic connexion with the compound soft substance. These
zoophytes increase by gemmation or budding; some throw
up germs from the disk, as in Astread&aelig;; others laterally,
as in Caryophillid&aelig;; and some spirally along the stem, as
in Madreporid&aelig;; examples of these modes of reproduction
are often found in fossil corals. The increase of coral-rocks
is produced by the continual formation of new masses,
by the successive generations which spring up as it were
from the bodies of their parents; layer upon layer, and tier
upon tier, of Helianthoid polypidoms, are found to compose
many of the coralline limestones of the pal&aelig;ozoic formations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Anthozoa.</span>&mdash;The first group of extinct corals to
be noticed under this head is the <i>Graptolitid&aelig;</i>, a family

them to the order Hydroida.</p>

<p><i>Graptolites</i> (proper), a single series of cells united together
at the base, and adhering along the sides nearly to the orifice
of each cell, as in <i>fig. 1a</i>. <i>Monoprion</i> of M. Barrande.</p>

<p><i>Rastrites.</i>&mdash;The axis reduced to a mere line, on which the
cells are placed at relatively wide intervals, and but slightly
inclined. These two genera are supposed to have been hydroid
zoophytes, and related to the Sertularid&aelig;.</p>

<p>Sir R. Murchison remarks, that the nature of the strata
in which these remains occur in Radnorshire, indicates a
condition of the sea, well suited to the habits of the family
of Pennatulid&aelig;, or Sea-pens; for the recent species live in
mud and slimy sediment, and the fossils are imbedded in a
finely levigated <i>mud-stone</i>, which, from its structure, must
have been tranquilly deposited.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I will next describe the single lamellated Anthozoa, and
afterwards notice those corals which consist of an aggregation
of radiated cells, either frondescent, or disposed in solid
masses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fungia</span> (<i>Wond.</i> p. 623).&mdash;The corals thus named, from
their supposed resemblance to fungi, are of a depressed form,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"> 257 </a></span>
and have the under surface scabrous; they are divided above
by numerous lamell&aelig;, or plates, which radiate from a central,
oblong depression.</p>

<p>When living, the solid stony polyparium is enclosed in the
gelatinous mass by which it was secreted, and there are numerous
tentacula around the central cavity, or sac. These
zoophytes may be compared to the <i>Actini&aelig;</i>, or Sea-Anemones,
from which they differ only in having a calcareous
axis, while the Actini&aelig; have a tough albuminous integument.

abundance of these relics: being literally composed of an

of Practical Geology, in London), that was discovered by
Mr. Samuel Stutchbury,<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> in a vein of hematitic iron ore.
It is a large mass, in which the entire substance of the
coral is transmuted into a metallic ore, forming one of the
most interesting natural electrotypes I have ever seen. In
this instance, a block of Lithodendron must have lain in a
vein or fissure of the rock, and its animal membrane have
resisted the action of the gaseous emanations, or mineral
solutions, while the calcareous polypidom was dissolved, and
the metallic matter deposited atom by atom, as in the case
of pseudo-morphous crystals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gorgonia.</span>&mdash;Of the flexible anthozoan coral, which from
the flabellated form of the polyparium is generally called
"Venus's fan," and by naturalists <i>Gorgonia</i>, a few fossil
species have been discovered and determined. From the
friable arenaceous limestone beds of Maestricht, which abound
in corals, fine specimens of a delicate species are occasionally
procured. <i>Wond.</i> p. 320, <i>fig.</i> 5, shows the character of this
fossil zoophyte.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Bryozoa.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL BRYOZOA.</div>

<p>The second class of Polypifera, the <span class="smcap">Bryozoa</span> or <i>Polyzoa</i>,
are of a much higher order of organization than those which
have engaged our attention. The body is not symmetrical,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"> 266 </a></span>
nor capable of contraction and expansion, as in the Anthozoa:
it consists of a digestive cavity or sac, which is bent on itself
and open at both extremities. The outer integument is
either membranaceous or horny; sometimes calcareous. The
oral aperture or mouth is surrounded by a circle of tentacula,
from eight to twelve or more in number, and these
tentacles are clothed with vibratile cilia. (<i>Wond.</i> p. 606,
the polype of <i>Flustra pilosa</i>.)</p>

<p>The polypes in this order never occur singly; they are
always united by a common integument, but each enjoys an
individual existence. The animal can extend its tentacula
and protrude the mouth from the cell, but the rest of the
body is incapable of extension or contraction. These polypifera
increase by germination. In their organization, they
so closely approach the mollusca, that in recent zoological
systems they are placed in that class. The ciliated character
of their tentacula has also led to their being named
<i>Cilio-branchiata</i>. But as it is desirable in a work of this
elementary nature to avoid conflicting opinions as much as
possible, the fossil Bryozoa will be considered as corals, in
the general sense of that term.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLUSTRA. ESCHARA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Flustra</span> (<i>Sea-mat</i>). <a href="#lign_89"><i>Lign.</i> 89, <i>fig.</i> 4, 5.</a>&mdash;The polyparium
is either membranaceous and flexible, calcareous and encrusting,
or foliaceous, composed of cells, arranged in juxtaposition,
more or less quadrangular, flat, with a distinct
border, disposed on a flat surface, or on opposite surfaces, as
in the <i>F. foliacea</i>.</p>

<p>This is one of the most common genera of the encrusting
and frondescent zoophytes. The <i>Flustra</i> consists of a cluster,
or aggregation of polypes, invisible to the naked eye; under
the microscope, the polype is found to be a transparent gelatinous
body bent on itself, with a sac or digestive cavity,
having two apertures, the external margin of which terminates
in eight or ten tentacula, clothed with cilia; the
whole is surrounded by a firm wall, constituting a cell, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"> 267 </a></span>
which the animal can protrude its tentacula and upper part.
(Figures of the living polypes of Flustr&aelig;, <i>Wond.</i> p. 605,
<i>pl.</i> vi. <i>fig.</i> 6, 7.)</p>

<p>Many species of <i>Flustr&aelig;</i> occur in the British strata: the
encrusting forms are attached to echinites, shells, &amp;c.; the
foliaceous are imbedded in chalk, sand, sandstone, &amp;c. In
Mr. Morris's <i>Cat. Brit. Foss.</i> ten species are enumerated;
none of these are from formations below the Chalk. I have
selected for illustration a Flustra attached to an echinite
from Lewes. <a href="#lign_89"><i>Lign.</i> 89</a>, <i>fig.</i> 5, represents a small portion of
the natural size; and <i>fig.</i> 4, a few cells magnified, to show
their form and arrangement. A foliaceous zoophyte, apparently
a bryozoon, is abundant in the Sussex and Kentish
chalk, and is often disposed in angular folds. It is generally
of a ferruginous colour, and, from its friable texture,
it is probable the original consisted of a membranous polypidom
or calcareous substance; specimens sometimes extend
over several square inches of the chalk. It is common in
the chalk-pit at Off ham, near Lewes.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

under the name of <i>Brachiolites angularis</i>; it presents ten deep, flat,

minute recent corals thus designated are allied to <i>Flustra</i>,
but separated from that genus by the cells being disposed in
a single series, and united by connecting tubes. I notice
this genus to direct attention to a very curious polypidom
from the Greensand of Maidstone, presented to me by Mr.
Bensted. The specimen is attached to a fragment of shell.
The cells, five of which are represented, <i>fig.</i> 10, are elliptical,
with the aperture above, and towards one extremity; they
are united by very slender, hollow filaments: <i>fig.</i> 3, two of

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_253" id="Footnote_253"></a><a href="#FNanchor_253"><span class="label">[253]</span></a> I refer this fossil to the genus <i>Crisia</i> with some hesitation; perhaps

of the latter are branched.</p></div>

<p>The fragmentary relics of numerous minute and elegant
corals, constitute a considerable portion of the mass of some
of the white chalk strata; several genera of these zoophytes
are figured in Mr. Dixon's beautiful work, and described by
Mr. Lonsdale. Attached to the surface of shells, &amp;c., and
sometimes standing erect in little crannies, or hollows, of the
flints, many beautiful corals may often be detected with the
aid of a lens. By brushing chalk in cold water, and examining
the deposit, the student will probably discover several
of the species figured in <a href="#lign_89"><i>Lign.</i> 89</a>, which we proceed to describe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Retepora</span> (<i>Lace-Coral</i>). <a href="#lign_89"><i>Lign.</i> 89, <i>fig.</i> 13.</a>&mdash;A very thin
calcareous polyparium, disposed like net-work in foliaceous
and branching plates; cells opening either on the upper or

<p>These are an elegant tribe of corals, of which many species
occur in the Chalk formation at Maestricht, in the white-chalk
of England, in the mountain limestone of Yorkshire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"> 270 </a></span>
(<i>Phil. York.</i>), and in the Silurian deposits (<i>Sil. Syst.</i>). It
may be useful to state, that in the description of the fossil
retepores, the openings in the net-work are called fenestrules&mdash;the
spaces between the ends, <i>dissepiments</i>&mdash;and those between
the fenestrules, interstices. A delicate fossil retepore
from the mountain limestone of Yorkshire (<i>R. flexa</i>), is
figured <a href="#lign_89"><i>Lign.</i> 89, <i>fig.</i> 13</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fenestrella.</span>&mdash;Cells very small, indistinct externally, with
small prominent openings; polyparium stony, fixed at the
base, composed of branches, which inosculate by growth, and
form a cup. Numerous delicate corals, formerly arranged

placed in this genus by Mr. Lonsdale. (<i>Sil. Syst.</i> p. 677.)</p>

composed of vertical lamin&aelig;, with an intermediate
foraminated structure; apertures to the tubular cavities distributed
over the surface; exterior varying with age." It
has slender round dichotomous branches, and the polyparium
when entire must have formed an elegant plexus of coral.
A layer an inch thick, full of branches of this zoophyte, is
exposed on the face of the chalk cliffs, near Dover; and
beautiful masses, several inches square, made up of this
coral, Idmonea and Pustulopora, may be obtained. The
microscopic specimen figured in <a href="#lign_69"><i>Lign.</i> 69</a>, was obtained with
many other corals by washing chalk with a brush, and examining
the detritus deposited.</p>

<p>We have now described all the fossil corals figured in
<a href="#lign_89"><i>Lign.</i> 89</a>; and have shown what interesting organisms may
be detected in a few grains of calcareous earth. It would
be easy to give restored figures of the beings whose stony
skeletons are the subject of these remarks, from their close
resemblance to existing species; every pore and cell might
be represented fraught with life; here the agile inmates,
with their little arms fully expanded, and in rapid motion;
there retreating within their recesses, and devouring the infinitesimal
living atoms that constitute their food; or rapidly
shrinking up their tentacula upon the approach of danger;
even their varied colours might be introduced, and thus the
beautiful and highly interesting picture drawn by the imagination,
of a group of living zoophytes of the ancient chalk
ocean, be presented to the eye.</p>

<p>Although, for convenience, I have selected the above examples
principally from the cretaceous strata, the reader must
not suppose that other deposits are not equally prolific in
these remains. The Coral-rag of the Oolite, many beds of
the Mountain limestone, and those of Dudley and Wenlock of
the Silurian System, contain myriads of minute polypidoms
associated with the coralline masses of which we have already
treated. Exquisite figures of the Silurian corals, by Mr.
Scharf, are given in <i>Sil. Syst.</i> pl. xv. xvi. and described by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"> 273 </a></span>

a coral often met with in the gravel-pits at Faringdon, (<i>ante</i>,
<a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>.,) which is referred by Mr, Morris to this genus. It is
composed of short cylindrical anastomosing tubular branches,
emanating from an expanded base, divided internally by
transverse parallel plates, covered with exceedingly minute
pores or cells, disposed in meshes; the plates surround a
hollow axis; the structure is well shown in the figure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lunulites.</span> <a href="#lign_70"><i>Lign.</i> 70.</a>&mdash;The polyparium is stony, orbicular,

by Mr. Walter Mantell. The natural affinities of
this genus are not determined with precision; but I have
placed it with the Bryozoa in accordance with the opinion
of M. de Blainville. It is an elegant white coral, and easily
recognized among the minute organisms of the chalk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Distribution of Fossil Zoophytes.</span>&mdash;Although
the geological distribution of fossil zoophytes affords
less striking phenomena than that of the vegetable kingdom,
yet some interesting reflections are suggested by the facts
we have thus cursorily noticed. We find that in the most
ancient seas of which any vestiges of their inhabitants remain,
these forms of vitality existed, and produced the same
physical results as at the present time; giving rise to coral-reefs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"> 274 </a></span>
and banks of coral-limestones, and largely contributing
to the solid materials of the crust of the globe. Nearly
400 British species are enumerated by Mr. Morris, and the
list has subsequently been greatly extended by the labours
of Phillips, Portlock, Lonsdale, McCoy, Milne Edwards, and
other eminent naturalists.</p>

<p>The Tertiary formations afford numerous species of Caryophylli&aelig;,
Flustr&aelig;, Eschar&aelig;, Spongia, &amp;c.; and the <i>Crag</i>,
several genera that are as yet but imperfectly determined.
The older Tertiary, or Eocene deposits, contain Turbinoli&aelig;,
Astre&aelig;, Fungi&aelig;, Meandrin&aelig;, and species of other
genera, the recent types of which are inhabitants of tropical
seas.</p>

<p>The zoophytes of the British Chalk have been illustrated
in detail by Mr. Lonsdale in Dixon's Cretaceous and Tertiary
Fossils of the South-East of England; and by Dr.
Milne Edwards in the Monographs of the Pal&aelig;ontological
Society.</p>

<p>In the Maestricht deposits, lamelliferous corals, as Astre&aelig;,
Fungi&aelig;, Meandrin&aelig;, &amp;c. prevail, and may be extracted
from the friable arenaceous limestones in a fine state of
preservation. In the White Chalk and Greensand of this
country, the Spongites and allied genera are abundant, and
associated with Caryophylli&aelig;, Astre&aelig;, and many forms of
Bryozoa.</p>

<p>But in the cretaceous formation of England, no coral-reefs
are observable; the zoophytal remains, with but a few local
exceptions, occur promiscuously intermingled with the fishes,
shells, Radiaria, and other marine exuvi&aelig;; although many
layers, or thin seams of chalk and marl, are largely composed
of the detritus of corals, like the modern deposits of
the Bermudas (<i>Wond.</i> p. 613). These phenomena are in accordance
with the lithological characters of the White Chalk
strata, and the nature of its mollusca, both of which indicate
a deep sea; and coral-reefs are only formed at moderate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"> 275 </a></span>
depths. But in regions where the sea was shallow, during
the deposition of the cretaceous rocks, beds of coral limestone
were produced; and these also contain littoral (sea-shore)
shells, associated with the usual sponges and zoophytes
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 613).</p>

<p>In the marine secondary formations antecedent to the cretaceous,
namely, the Lias and Oolite, coral-reefs, which appear
to have undergone no change save that of elevation from the
bottom of the sea, and the consolidation of their materials
by mineral infiltrations, demonstrate a condition of the ocean
in our latitudes, which is now only met with in the tropics
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 614).</p>

<p>The limestones of the Carboniferous, Devonian, and Silurian
formations, abound in anthozoan corals, and among
them are many kinds of Cyathophyllum, Lithododendra, Syringopora,
Catenipora, Graptolites, &amp;c., which are characteristic
of these deposits.</p>

<p>The Silurian zoophytes are figured in <i>Sil. Syst.</i>; and the
splendid works on the British Pal&aelig;ozoic Fossils, by Prof.
Sedgwick and Prof. McCoy, now in course of publication,
contain many admirable figures of new, or but imperfectly
known species.</p>

<p>The extensive beds of coralline limestones, which are found
in the Silurian strata, wherever they occur,&mdash;for the limestones
of this system in North America are characterized by
the same species of corals as those of England,&mdash;seem to indicate
that a more equal temperature prevailed throughout
the ocean, at that geological epoch, than at the present time,
when the geographical distribution of the coral zoophytes is
strictly limited by temperature. The reef-forming genera
are now confined to waters where the temperature is not
below 70&deg;; their most prolific development being 76&deg;. The
apparent exception, the occurrence of coral-reefs at the Bermudas,
is found to depend upon proximity to the Gulf Stream
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 614), which brings down the thermal waters of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"> 276 </a></span>
the tropics, and increases the local temperature of the sea
in those localities.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ON COLLECTING FOSSIL CORALS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On Collecting Fossil Corals.</span>&mdash;Few instructions are required
for the collection of fossil zoophytes; for as the most
important characters of the several kinds have been pointed
out in the previous descriptions, the student will be able to
select illustrative specimens for his cabinet. The minute
corals, &amp;c. of the Chalk, and other limestones, are to be obtained
by the same process as that directed for the discovery
and preservation of the foraminifera, and other microscopic
organisms, at the end of the next chapter. The larger examples
should be left attached to a piece of chalk, when practicable,
and the surrounding stone removed with a knife or graver,
so as to expose as much of the fossil as may be required for
the display of its characters, without loosening its attachment
to the block. When the investing chalk is very hard,
frequently pencilling the specimen with vinegar, or dilute
hydrochloric acid, will soften the stone, and render its removal
easy, by means of a soft brush: when acid is employed,
the specimen must afterwards be well rinsed in cold
water.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_260" id="Footnote_260"></a><a href="#FNanchor_260"><span class="label">[260]</span></a> It may be well to caution the collector against employing sulphuric
acid (commonly called <i>oil</i> of <i>vitriol</i>) for this purpose, for a
white insoluble deposit (sulphate of lime) will thus be formed on the
specimen, and its appearance irremediably injured. Many of the
fossil corals obtained from the chalk of Dover Cliffs, are so saturated
with muriate of soda, from long exposure to the spray of the sea, as
to be liable to decomposition in the course of a few weeks, and are
therefore not worth purchasing of the dealers.</p></div>

<p>The zoophytes that are in part flint, and part chalk, as
the Ventriculites, (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_244">p. 244</a>, <a href="#lign_81"><i>Lign.</i> 81</a>,) can rarely be obtained,
except through the quarrymen who have been instructed
how to extract them from the rock. The first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"> 277 </a></span>
specimen of this kind that came under my notice, I discovered
while breaking a mass of chalk, in search of fungiform
flints; when, to my great delight, I found the fossil,
<a href="#lign_81"><i>Lign.</i> 81</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3, by which at once, and for the first time,
was shown the connexion between the chalk specimens, <a href="#lign_8"><i>Lign.</i>
8</a>, <i>figs.</i> 1, 2, and the flints figured in <a href="#lign_8"><i>Lign.</i> 8</a>, <i>figs.</i> 2, 3, 6,
7, 8. Upon showing this fossil to the quarrymen, and
exciting their attention by suitable rewards, I obtained
the illustrative series now in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> Much
light would be thrown on the nature of other zoophytes
of the chalk that are invested with flint, if due care were
taken in the collection of specimens, and they were examined
before extracted from the rock. Loose, delicate specimens,
whether from the chalk or tertiary strata, should be affixed
with strong gum-water to cards, or pieces of thin board,
covered with coloured paper.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_261" id="Footnote_261"></a><a href="#FNanchor_261"><span class="label">[261]</span></a> Petrifactions, Room VI. p. 466.</p></div>

<p>The Greensand Spongites, Siphoni&aelig;, &amp;c. may often be
extracted from the rock tolerably perfect, by a well-directed
blow of the hammer; but fragile species should be left attached
to a block, and the surrounding stone be carefully
chiselled away, so as to expose the most essential characters.</p>

<p>The Faringdon zoophytes are, for the most part, encrusted
by an aggregation of minute polyparia, shells, and detritus,
which may be partially removed by washing with a stiff
brush, and their cavities cleared with a stout penknife, removing
the extraneous matter by <i>chipping</i>, not by scraping,
or the surface will be injured. In this manner the beautiful
specimens figured, <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>., were developed.</p>

<p>The Corals in the hard limestones can seldom be chiselled
out to advantage; for the most part, polished sections best
exhibit the form and structure of the originals.</p>

<p>Weather-worn or water-worn masses of coral limestone
often display the structure of the zoophytes of which they
are in a great measure composed, in a beautiful state of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"> 278 </a></span>
sculpture and relief: the silicified or calcified corals appearing
as perfect as if fresh from the sea. The mural rocks of
coral limestone at Florence Court, the seat of the Earl of
Enniskillen, are in many parts encrusted, as it were, with
syringopora and other tubular corals, laid bare uninjured by
the long and insensible effect of atmospheric erosion. A
beautiful illustration of the old aphorism,&mdash;"Aqua cavat
lapidem non vi sed s&aelig;pe cadendo,"&mdash;is afforded by the
splendid examples of catenipor&aelig;, fungi&aelig;, caryophill&aelig;, sculptured
in alto-relievo on the face of the Silurian rocks over
which dash the rapids at the Falls of the Ohio.</p>

<p>The silicified zoophytes of the West Indies, and those
from Ava and the Sub-Himalayas, form beautiful subjects
for the microscope; and chips, or sections, should be prepared
in the manner recommended for fossil wood in the
same state of mineralization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOCALITIES OF FOSSIL ZOOPHYTES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">British localities.</span>&mdash;The gravels and sands of the Crag
afford most favourable sites for obtaining tertiary zoophytes.</p>

<p>In the London clay at Bracklesham Bay, a species of
Astrea (<i>A. Websteri</i>) is often met with attached to flints and
pebbles.</p>

<p>In the Greensand of Atherfield, in the Isle of Wight, an
elegant coral (<i>Astrea elegans</i>) is by no means rare.</p>

<p>The Greensand gravel-pits, near Faringdon, in Berkshire,
abound, as already mentioned, (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>.,) in many kinds
of sponges, and other porifera; and the quarries of oolitic
limestone in the vicinity of that town, yield the usual corals
of the Jurassic formation in great profusion, I know of no
locality richer in fossil zoophytes, than Faringdon.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>The quarries of that division of the Oolite called Coral-rag
(as in the north-west of Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Gloucestershire,
&amp;c.), afford the usual corals of the Oolite.</p>

<p>The Oolite near Bath contains many species, and large
masses of a minute coral (<i>Eunomia radiata</i>), are abundant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"> 279 </a></span></p>

<p>At Steeple Ashton, in Wiltshire, numerous oolitic corals
may be obtained. The silicified <i>Astre&aelig;</i>, of Tisbury, in the
same county, deserve particular notice (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_263">p. 263</a>).</p>

<p>Clifton, near Bristol, and Torquay and Babbicombe, on
the Devonshire coast, are celebrated for their coralline
marbles and pebbles; and many of the Derbyshire limestones
are equally prolific in similar remains. The Devonian
marbles are so largely employed for ornamental purposes,&mdash;
as brooches, tables, and side-boards,&mdash;that the figures produced
by the sections of the enclosed corals must be familiar
to the reader.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL STELLERID&AElig;; COMPRISING THE CRINOIDEA OR LILY-LIKE
ANIMALS; AND THE ASTERIAD&AElig;, OR STAR-FISHES.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Radiata</span>, or radiated animals, so designated because the
parts of which the body is composed are arranged around a
common centre or axis, are divided into three sub-classes;
namely, 1, the <i>Polypifera</i>, whose fossil remains were treated
of in the previous chapter; 2. the <i>Acalepha</i>, or Jelly-fishes,
whose structures are so perishable as to render it improbable
that any vestiges of them will be found in a fossil state,
though imprints of the general outline of certain kinds may
possibly occur;<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and, 3, the <i>Echinodermata</i>, comprehending
under that term the <i>Stellerid&aelig;</i>, or Crinoids and Star-fishes,
and the <i>Echinoderms</i>, properly so called. This sub-class
is the subject of the present section; it comprises four
orders, viz.</p>

<table summary="list">
<tr><td class="tdl">
<span class="smcap">Crinoidea</span>, or Lily-like Animals.<br />
<span class="smcap">Asteriad&aelig;</span>, or Star-fishes.<br />
<span class="smcap">Echinid&aelig;</span>, or Sea-urchins.<br />
<span class="smcap">Holothuriad&aelig;</span>, or Sea-slugs.<br />
</td></tr>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_264" id="Footnote_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_264"><span class="label">[264]</span></a> The impression of an Acaleph resembling an <i>&AElig;quorea</i> (a kind of
Medusa), is stated by M. Pictet to have been observed in a slab of
schistose rock, in Germany.</p></div>

<p>Vestiges of the Stellerida are among the earliest relics of
animal organization hitherto discovered. Many kinds of
Crinoidea abound in the Silurian rocks, and one genus of
Star-fishes occurs in the same deposits: the Echinid&aelig; first
appear in the Devonian formation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"> 281 </a></span></p>

<p>The Echinodermata possess the radiated type of structure
in an eminent degree; especially the Asterioid&aelig; and the
Echinid&aelig;, of which the common Star-fish, and Sea-urchin,
are familiar examples. The external integument or skin is
in many kinds protected by spines, (hence the name Echinoderms
or spiny-skin,) and perforated by numerous foramina
for the imbibition and transmission of sea-water, and
for the protection of minute soft tubular processes (called
<i>pseudopodia</i>), which constitute organs of adhesion and locomotion.</p>

<p>The first two orders have endo-skeletons, composed of
numerous ossicula or little calcareous bones: in the third
order, the Echinid&aelig;, the body is inclosed in a calcareous
case or shell, formed of numerous plates closely adjusted to
each other; in the fourth order, the Sea-slugs, the body has
only a tough outer integument without movable spines.</p>

<p>Diversified in form and external appearance as are the
Invertebrata thus grouped together, they are naturally
related by their organization. The Crinoidea may be regarded
as Star-fishes fixed to one spot by a jointed stem;
the Star-fishes as free Crinoidea; the Echinid&aelig; as Star-fishes
with the rays coalesced and united into a globular
or spherical case; and the Holothuri&aelig;, as elongated Sea-urchins,
destitute of spines, and without a calcareous
envelop.</p>


<div class="sidenote">CRINOIDEA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crinoidea.</span>&mdash;The animals of this order are subdivided
into families and genera according to the number, form, and
arrangement of the plates composing the calcareous case or
receptacle, and the structure of the arms and column. In
one living family, the <i>Comatulid&aelig;</i>, the body is free; and
in one fossil genus, the <i>Marsupite</i>, the animal is capable of
locomotion through the water.</p>

<p>The essential character of the <i>Crinoidea</i>,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>&mdash;so named
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"> 282 </a></span>
because the receptacle and anus of some kinds resemble
when in repose a closed lily or tulip,&mdash;are well exemplified
in the recent <i>Pentacrinus</i>; the only known living form
that is identical in structure with the numerous extinct
tribes, that swarmed in the seas of the pal&aelig;ozoic and
secondary ages.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pentacrinus</span> (<i>F. caput-medus&aelig;</i>, <i>Wond.</i> p. 647), is an
inhabitant of the Caribbean Sea, and but rarely obtained;
there are specimens in the British Museum<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> and in the
Hunterian Collection of the College of Surgeons.</p>

<p>This animal has a long stem or column, which is composed
of pentagonal calcareous plates or ossicula, articulated
to each other by radiated surfaces, and is fixed by the base
to a rock, or other firm body. The column supports a
vasiform receptacle or cup, formed of calcareous plates in
close apposition; in which the digestive and other viscera
are situated. The upper part of the receptacle is covered
by an integument in which there is an aperture for the
mouth. From the margin or brim proceed ten multi-radiate
arms, which subdivide into branches of extreme
tenuity. On the upper and inner side of the arms are
numerous articulated feelers or pinn&aelig;. The ova are situated
externally on and near the base of the arms, as in the
Comatulid&aelig;; a family of living Star-fishes, or more properly
Crinoids, which have a receptacle, surrounded by articulated
and multi-radiate arms, but are free animals, being destitute
of a column.</p>

<p>In the living state of Pentacrinus, the skeleton&mdash;for such
are the specimens in our museums&mdash;was of course covered
and concealed by the soft integuments and tissues by which
it was secreted. The ossicula composing the stem are pentangular,
and very numerous; they have a central perforation,
and their articulating surfaces are ornamented by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"> 283 </a></span>
pentapetalous striations. There are numerous side-arms sent
off from the column in groups of five, at uncertain distances.
The mouth is situated in the centre of a plated integument
spread over the top of the receptacle. The arms,
which arise from the margin of the latter, surround the
mouth, and when spread out, with their numerous pinn&aelig;
or feelers expanded, form a net for the capture of prey;
and are the organs by which the animal obtains food, and
conveys it to the mouth.</p>


<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL CRINOIDEA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Crinoidea.</span>&mdash;The fossil crinoids, like the recent prototype
above described, consist of an articulated column, and
a receptacle formed of calcareous plates, and articulated arms
or tentacula. They constitute two groups; the <i>Encrinites</i>,
in which the ossicula of the column are subcylindrical and
smooth; and the <i>Pentacrinites</i>, with a stem composed of
pentangular ossicles, as in the living Pentacrinus.</p>

<p>The petrified remains consist of the ossicula of the column,
arms, and tentacula; of the plates of the receptacle; and
of the peduncle, or process of attachment by which the
animal was fixed to the rock. The peduncle is in some
species flat and expanded, like that of the <i>Gorgonia</i>; in
others, it consists of long jointed processes. These several
parts are commonly found detached, and intermingled with
detritus in the strata; throughout extensive beds of encrinital
marble, vestiges of the receptacle are but seldom discoverable.
In some localities the skeletons are preserved entire,
and lie expanded on the surface of the layers of shale, clay,
or limestone, as if the animals had been enveloped by the
soft deposit when alive in their native seas.</p>

<p>These remarks will serve to convey a general idea of the
nature of the crinoidal remains which are scattered through
certain rocks in such inconceivable quantities; for, much as
the columns may differ in form, the ossicula in their markings,
and the plates of the receptacle in their configuration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284"> 284 </a></span>
and ornament, the same general type of structure prevails
throughout the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Stems and Ossicula of Crinoidea.</span>&mdash;(<i>Bd.</i> pl.
xlix-lii. <i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. xlvii.)&mdash;The detached ossicula and
stems are so common in many places, that they attracted
the notice of the earlier collectors, by whom the single
pieces were termed <i>trochites</i> (wheel-stones), and the united
series <i>entrochites</i>. In the north of England these fossils are
called <i>Fairy-stones</i>, and the circular perforated ossicula
<i>Saint Cuthbert's beads</i>; the latter were worn as ornaments
by the ancient Britons, and are occasionally found in tumuli.</p>

<p>These petrifactions present considerable variety in form,
and in the markings on their articulating surfaces, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"> 285 </a></span>
are often radiated and sculptured in floriform and stellular
figures (<a href="#lign_90"><i>Lign.</i> 90</a>, <i>fig.</i> 7, 9, and <a href="#lign_91"><i>Lign.</i> 91</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3, 4). The central
perforation is small in some species, and large and pentagonal
in others. The ossicula of the Encrinites often vary
in size in the same column, being circular and elliptical, and
thick or thin, alternately, as in the upper part of the column
of the Lily Encrinite, <a href="#lign_91"><i>Lign.</i> 91</a>, <i>fig.</i> 6; by which great flexibility
and freedom of motion were obtained.</p>

<p>The pentagonal stems also display many modifications;
some have five, others but four sides (<a href="#lign_90"><i>Lign.</i> 90</a>, <i>fig.</i> 6, 8, 10,
and 91, <i>fig.</i> 7, 9); in some the angles are acute, in others
rounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pulley-stones.</span> <a href="#lign_90"><i>Lign.</i> 90, <i>fig.</i> 1.</a>&mdash;The circular, or pentagonal
channel formed by the united ossicula of the column,
has given rise to the curious fossils called in Derbyshire the
Screw, or Pulley-stones, which are flint casts of those cavities
that occur in the beds of chert, interstratified with the
mountain limestone. The siliceous matter, when fluid, must
have filled up the channel and invested the stem: the original
calcareous ossicles have since been dissolved, and the casts,
now solid cylinders of flint, resembling a pulley, remain.
The masses of chert are often impressed with the ornamented
articulating surfaces of the trochites.</p>

<p>In the quarries on Middleton Moor, near Cromford, Derbyshire,
where extensive beds of limestone composed of crinoideal
remains are worked for chimney-pieces and other
ornamental purposes, beautiful examples of these fossils may
be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> The cavities of the column and ossicles are
often filled with white calcareous spar, while the ground of
the marble is of a dark reddish brown colour; in other
varieties of the Derbyshire encrinital limestones, the substance
of the fossils is white, and the ground dark grey or

<p>The <i>receptacle</i> which contained the viscera is extremely
diversified in form, and in the number, shape, and arrangement
of its plates: the annexed figure 2, <a href="#lign_92"><i>Lign.</i> 92</a>, illustrates
the several pieces that enter into its composition.
The genera, or sub-genera, are based on the modifications of
shape and structure of the receptacle; and their names are
composed of the termination <i>crinus</i>, or <i>crinites</i> (signifying
stone-lily), with a term prefixed expressive of the generic
character: thus we have <i>Apiocrinus</i>, or <i>Apiocrinites</i>, Pear
Encrinite.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_270" id="Footnote_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_270"><span class="label">[270]</span></a> The termination <i>crinus</i> is now generally employed, instead of
<i>crinites</i>; the latter is preferable, as it indicates the fossil nature of the
specimens. A more expressive name than <i>Encrinite</i> was suggested by
Mr. Martin, of Derbyshire; that of <i>Stylastrit&aelig;</i> or Column-Stars.</p></div>

<p>The receptacle being round and inflated, and composed of
pieces articulated with the stems, and supporting the arms by
similar articulations, are the generic characters of <i>Apiocrinites</i>
of Miller. When round but not inflated&mdash;<i>Encrinus</i>,
when pentagonal, <i>Pentacrinus</i>. When the receptacle is
composed of angular plates united at the edges and forming
several series or stages, it constitutes the basis of the following
genera: viz,&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Platycrinus</i>; two series, the one of three, the other of five
plates.</p>

<p><i>Pateriocrinus</i>; three series each of five plates.</p>

<p><i>Cyathocrinus</i>; three series of five plates, the last with five
intercalated pieces.</p>

<p><i>Actinocrinus</i>; several series of plates: the first composed
of three, the second of five, and the others of many pieces.</p>

<p><i>Rhodocrinus</i>; several series of plates that are covered
externally with radiated ridges. The first course consists of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"> 288 </a></span>
three, the second of five, the third of ten, and the others of
many plates.</p>

<p><i>Eugeniacrinus</i>; of five pieces united into one receptacle.</p>


<p>This brief explanation will enable the student to comprehend
the nature of the almost infinite variety of figure and
ornament which the fossil crinoidea present, and the principles
of nomenclature generally adopted by modern authors.
To attempt an enumeration even of the genera would be inadmissible
in these volumes. The late Mr. Miller's "Natural
History of the Crinoidea or Lily-shaped Animals,"<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> will

652.)&mdash;The Apiocrinite or Pear-Encrinite of Bradford, from
its size, and the abundance of its remains in one particular
locality, is the most generally known of all the British fossil
Crinoids. It abounds in the beds of oolite, in the quarries
on the heights above the picturesquely situated town of
Bradford, in Wiltshire. The receptacle, detached ossicula,
and the pedicle, are very common; and in some instances
the entire endo-skeleton, from the peduncle to the extremities
of the arms, is preserved. The late Channing Pearce, Esq.,
of Bradford, by unremitting attention to the collection of
these fossils, obtained the beautiful specimens deposited in
the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a></p>

<p>This Apiocrinite has a smooth receptacle of a pyriform
shape, composed of large thin plates with radiated articulating
surfaces; the stem is short and strong; the arms are simple,
resembling those of the <i>Marsupite</i>; the peduncle spreads out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"> 289 </a></span>

<p>Sir Charles Lyell mentions an interesting fact relating to
the occurrence of these fossils in the Oolitic limestone at
Bradford. In Burfield quarry, on the heights that overlook
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"> 290 </a></span>
the town, a bed of limestone was exposed, the upper surface
of which was incrusted with the stony peduncles or roots of
Apiocrinites; upon this stratum was a layer of clay, in which
were innumerable remains of receptacles and ossicula of
stems and arms; some of the stems were erect, others prostrate,
and throughout the clay were the dismembered remains.
This submarine forest of Crinoideans must therefore have
flourished in the clear sea-water, till invaded by a current
loaded with mud that overwhelmed the living zoophytes,
and entombed them in the argillaceous deposit in which
their fossil remains are imbedded.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_275" id="Footnote_275"></a><a href="#FNanchor_275"><span class="label">[275]</span></a> Burfield quarry, on the heights of Bradford, is the locality referred
to; but I believe it is rarely that any specimens of the Apiocrinite are
to be found in an erect position. I could not learn from any of the
local collectors, that an example had been seen by them. When I
visited the quarry in June, 1848, no good section of the beds was
apparent: a few detached plates of Apiocrinites were the only relics
we could meet with. Mr. Reginald Mantell, when engaged on the
construction of the railway near Bradford, sought repeatedly, but in
vain, to discover any Apiocrinites in an erect position, or as if lying
on the spot where they grew.</p></div>

<p>The constituent substance of the ossicula and plates of the
Bradford Encrinite is calcareous, and has an oblique fracture;
the colour is generally a light ochre, or a bluish grey.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>

The pieces composing the column are cylindrical in the
upper part, and elliptical and angular in the lower, and are
articulated by a transversely-grooved surface. The two upper
joints are enlarged, and support the receptacle, which is
smooth and round (<i>fig.</i> 1). The column has articulated side-arms,
and the base numerous jointed processes of attachment,
which, when found apart from the column, have been mistaken

ossicles of other species belonging to the same genus,
or to allied genera, are frequently met with in the Kentish
and Sussex chalk. A common form is that figured in <a href="#lign_91"><i>Lign.</i>
91</a>, which is part of the receptacle of a crinoid, named as
above; it differs from the other Apiocrinites of the chalk
in the articulating surfaces of the ossicles not being radiated,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"> 292 </a></span>
and in the receptacle, which is small and pyriform, not
having a distinct cavity; there is only a median canal, which
is seen in a vertical section: but the entire structure of the
summit does not appear to be shown in any specimens
hitherto observed.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Encrinus liliiformis</span> (<i>Lily Encrinite</i>). <a href="#lign_91"><i>Lign.</i> 91, <i>fig.</i> 6.</a>&mdash;This
exquisite Crinoid is equally interesting and attractive
to the amateur collector and the naturalist. Its remains do
not occur in the British strata, and are only known in the
muschelkalk of Lower Saxony. The specimens in this country
are chiefly from Erkerode, in Brunswick; they are found
in a layer, about eighteen inches thick, of a soft argillaceous
cream-coloured limestone, chiefly made up of trochites, detached
ossicula, and a few fragile shells and corals.</p>

<p>The receptacle of the Lily Encrinite is smooth, and in the
form of a depressed vase; its base is composed of five plates,
upon which are placed three successive series of other plates,
with the uppermost of which the arms articulate. The stem
is formed of numerous perforated round ossicles, articulated
to each other by radiated grooved surfaces, and becoming
somewhat pentangular, and alternately larger and smaller,
towards the summit, to which the receptacle is fixed; a construction
admitting great freedom of motion.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>This Encrinite when lying in relief on the rock, with its
receptacle entirely or partially closed (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 548), so
strikingly resembles the bud or expanding flower of a Lily

<div class="sidenote">PENTACRINITES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pentacrinites.</span>&mdash;The description of the recent <i>Pentacrinus</i>
<i>caput-medus&aelig;</i> (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_282">p. 282</a>.), illustrates the characters of the
crinoideans whose fossil remains are so familiar to the pal&aelig;ontologist,
under the name of Pentacrinites. In these
animals the pieces composing the receptacle are firmly articulated
together; the rays of the disk are fixed immediately
to the summit of the column by special ossicula; and the
stem is composed of angular pieces, which are generally pentagonal.
The receptacle is small, and situated deep between
the bases of the arms; it is closed above by an integument
covered by minute plates or flat ossicles (<a href="#lign_92"><i>Lign.</i> 94, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>).
The fossil remains of several species are abundant in the
Lias and Oolite of Dorsetshire, Somersetshire, &amp;c. Slabs of
limestone may be extracted with the surface covered with
these crinoideans, spread out as if floating in their native
element; very commonly they are transmuted into sulphuret
of iron, or have a coating of brilliant pyrites.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The neighbourhoods
of Lyme Regis, and Charmouth, are celebrated for
these organic remains. A small specimen of the arms of a
pentacrinite on Lias shale is figured in <a href="#lign_93"><i>Lign.</i> 94, <i>fig.</i> 3</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_282" id="Footnote_282"></a><a href="#FNanchor_282"><span class="label">[282]</span></a> Pictorial Atlas, pl. li. lii.</p></div>

<p>The arms in many of the plumose pentacrinites are very
long and thickly beset with side-arms, and minute pinn&aelig;,
all of which are composed of separate articulated ossicles,
so that the number of bones in a single endo-skeleton of
those crinoids amounts to from fifty to one hundred and fifty
thousand distinct pieces. The Briarean Pentacrinite,<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> so
named from its numerous tentacula, is literally a tuft of
articulated processes, appearing like a delicate fibrous plume
attached to a stem. The <i>Pentacrinus Hiemeri</i> is a beautiful
example of this type of crinoids, of which there is a noble
group, comprising upwards of thirty individuals, on a slab
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"> 294 </a></span>
in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> exposed on the surface of the stone
in as perfect a state as if just dredged up from the bottom
of the sea. The pentacrinites are for the most part entire;
the peduncle being fixed, and the column extending upwards
in gentle undulations, and supporting the receptacle, from
which the arms are gracefully outspread in various attitudes.
The structure of the receptacle, and of the arms, and the
extreme delicacy of the finer tentacula made up of countless
minute ossicula, are admirably shown in this unique and
most instructive fossil.</p>

round ossicula, possesses side-arms, and is fixed by root-like
processes. The receptacle is of an irregular subspherical
form, the arms passing off at right angles like the spokes
from the nave of a wheel; hence the name. The base is
composed of three plates which support five hexagonals and
one pentagonal, and on these are three other series; from
the upper margin of the last, five arms are given off. The
receptacle is closed by a dome-shaped tesselated covering
(<a href="#lign_94"><i>Lign.</i> 94, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>), having on one side the opening for the
mouth and vent. The specimen, <i>fig.</i> 1, is a receptacle without
a stem, and with but a few joints of the arms; this is
the usual state in which these fossils are obtained. <i>Fig.</i> 2
is an <i>Actinocrinite</i> in which part of the brim of the receptacle
and of the arms has been removed in front, leaving a portion
of the coalesced arms partially surrounding the proboscideal
plated integument that covers the upper part of the
receptacle; the figure is from Mr. Miller's work, and is introduced
to illustrate the structure of these crinoideans.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p>

<p>The external surface of the plates of the receptacle in the

and ridges, so that detached plates have been mistaken for
those of Marsupites; see the restored figure of a Nave

beautiful form, allied to the Antinocrinoids, occurs in the
pal&aelig;ozoic rocks, and is named the Rose-encrinite by Miller.
The column is cylindrical and traversed by a pentagonal
canal. The rays or arms arise by a single ossicle and then
bifurcate: the receptacle is formed of three, five, ten, and
more numerous series of plates, which are ornamented
externally. A fine example of a crinoid of this type (<i>Hypanthocrinus</i>)
from the Wenlock limestone, is figured in the
London Pal&aelig;ontological Journal, pl. xxi.</p>

<p>In Sir R. Murchison's Sil. Syst. all the crinoids of the

<p><span class="smcap">Eugeniacrinus</span> (<i>Clove-like Encrinite</i>). <a href="#lign_92"><i>Lign.</i> 92, <i>fig.</i> 1.</a>&mdash;These
little crinoids, which resemble a clove in form, are
found at Mount Randen, in Switzerland, in Oolitic limestone.
The receptacle is simple in structure, for it has but one
series of plates; its cavity is very small. It had five arms:
the articulating surface of the ossicles is radiated. When
perfect this crinoidean must have somewhat resembled the
Lily Encrinite, but the plates are all anchylosed, or blended
together, which Mr. Miller attributed to an early stage of
growth.</p>

short, and formed of cylindrical, perforated ossicula, with
radiated surfaces, and has irregular side-arms. The receptacle
is composed of polygonal plates, divided by five perforated
grooves or furrows, which are of an elongated petalous
form, and converge in a rosette on the summit. The marginal
longitudinal rows of minute pores are not however for
the passage of soft membranous feelers, as in the ambulacra
of echinoderms, as was formerly conjectured, but are channels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"> 298 </a></span>
for the transit of vessels that supply an infinite number of
delicate simple tentacula, composed of extremely minute calcareous
ossicula, as in the other Crinoidea, but not subdivided
as in the Pentacrinites and Encrinites.</p>

<p>These articulated tentacula are arranged close together in
longitudinal rows on the ambulacral spaces; there being two
rows, each consisting of fifty tentacula, on every space. They
are directed upwards towards the vertex of the receptacle,
and appear to be the instruments for the capture and conveyance
of food to the mouth.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>There are several species of Pentremites, some of which
swarm in the cherty limestones of Kentucky. Mr. Say, to
whom we are indebted for the first satisfactory investigation

<p><span class="smcap">Cystidea.</span>&mdash;In the ancient fossiliferous strata there occurs
a remarkable family of crinoideans, which is supposed to be
restricted to the pal&aelig;ozoic ages; these fossils have been named
by Von Buch, <i>Cystide&aelig;</i>, from the body of the animal being
wholly inclosed in a cyst, or box. The receptacle is of a
spherical form, and composed of polygonal plates, articulated
to each other; it has distinct apertures for the mouth, vent,
and oviduct; the orifice of the latter is closed by valves. It
has a short pedicle, but no arms have been discovered, and
the Cystide&aelig; are generally described as Crinoids without
appendages of this kind. But in some members of this
group, there are not only arms and tentacula, but likewise
certain organs connected with the plates, which Prof E.
Forbes terms, "pectinated rhombs," the functions of which
are not obvious. The arms more closely resemble those of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"> 299 </a></span>
the Ophiurid&aelig; than of the Crinoidea.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> This order comprises
several genera, and is the type under which the Crinoidea

<p><span class="smcap">Marsupites Milleri.</span> <a href="#lign_92"><i>Lign.</i> 92, <i>fig.</i> 3</a>, <a href="#lign_96"><i>Lign.</i> 96.</a> (<i>Wond.</i>
p. 652.)&mdash;The fossil remains of a genus related to the Encrinites,
but separated from them by being unattached and free,
having no column of support, were first described by the
late Mr. Parkinson under the name of "<i>Tortoise Encrinite</i>"
(<i>Org. Rem.</i> vol. ii. pl. xiii. <i>fig.</i> 24, <i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. xlvii.);
but misled by the resemblance of some of the plates to those
of certain species of Actinocrinites, Mr. Parkinson supposed
the original to have possessed a jointed column. The examination
of specimens obtained from the Chalk of Lewes
and Brighton, enabled me to determine the true characters
of the original; the purse-like form when the arms are closed
suggested the name Marsupites (<i>purse-like</i>), by which it
is now generally known; the specific name <i>Milleri</i>, is in
commemoration of the late excellent and able author of the
Natural History of the Crinoidea.</p>

<p>The receptacle of the Marsupite is of a sub-ovate shape,
and rounded and entire at the dorsal extremity; a large
central plate forms its base, on which is placed a successive
series of pentagonal and hexagonal plates, the margins of
which are in contact, but not anchylosed nor firmly united;
to the periphery of this cup are articulated five arms, which
subdivide into ten rays, or tentacula. The top of the receptacle
was closed by an integument, covered by numerous
small semilunar plates, in the centre of which was situated
the oral aperture. The external surfaces of the plates of the
receptacle are generally granulated and radiated, as in <i>Lign.</i>
92, <i>fig.</i> 3; but in some specimens the surface is quite smooth,
a character which possibly may be specific. Some examples
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"> 300 </a></span>
have the surface granulated and rugous, and these Mr. Miller
regarded as distinct, and named <i>M. ornatus</i>. I have not of
late years been able to obtain specimens to determine this
question.</p>

<p>The Marsupites vary in size, from an inch to three inches
in length, exclusive of the arms. The receptacle is relatively
very capacious compared with that of other crinoideans.
The central plate is large, and of a pentagonal form,
without the slightest indication of any column or process of
attachment: five pentagonal plates are united to the sides
of the basal plate, and above these a like number of hexagonals,
which receive the five upper plates that constitute
the margin; these have each a semilunar depression, to
articulate with the first bones of the arms, or brachial appendages.</p>

<p>Detached plates and ossicula of marsupites are not uncommon
in the Chalk of Kent and Sussex;
nearly entire receptacles, filled with
chalk or flint, are occasionally found in
the pits near Lewes and Brighton; but
examples with remains of the arms are
extremely rare; and I have seen but one
specimen (which I collected from the
Sussex chalk), in which the plates of the
integument that covered the opening of
the receptacle are preserved.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The Marsupite is an exceedingly interesting
type, in a zoological point of
view, since it forms a link that unites the
Crinoidea with the Comatul&aelig;, or feather-stars,
which we shall presently notice.
Its general form and habits are sufficiently
indicated by the numerous specimens
that have been collected in the Chalk of the south-east
of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"> 301 </a></span></p>

<p>The body of the animal was inclosed in a crustaceous
case formed of large plates, articulated to each other by
suture; the mouth or oral aperture was situated in the centre
of the plated integumental cover of the receptacle. The
organs of locomotion and prehension consisted of five arms
or brachial appendages, formed of ossicula as in the crinoidea,
and the whole was invested with soft tissue or integuments.
When floating in the water, the creature could spread out
its tentacula, and form a net to capture its prey, and by
closing them, secure it, and convey it to its mouth. The
figure, <a href="#lign_96"><i>Lign.</i> 96</a>, is restored from specimens which separately
exhibit the parts here represented in connexion.</p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Fossil Asteriad&aelig;.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL ASTERIAD&AElig;.</div>

<p>The radiated animals, popularly called <i>Star-fishes</i>, from
their stellular forms, are so abundant on our coasts, that the
common five-rayed species must be familiar to all my readers
who indulge in rambles on the sea-shore, and will serve as
an illustration of the general appearance and structure of
the beings whose petrified remains now claim our attention.
This species belongs to the division of Asteriad&aelig;, in which the
rays are elongated, and far exceed in length the diameter of
the disk; in another group (<i>Goniastea</i>, or Cushion-star), the
body is angular, and the lobes or rays are short, and not
longer than the diameter; while in a third subdivision (<i>Comatula</i>
and <i>Ophiura</i>), the arms are distinct from the body, and
articulated, elongated, and ramified, as in the <i>Crinoidea</i>.</p>

<p>The external surface of the common Star-fish is soft, and
attached to a tough coriaceous integument, investing a skeleton
composed of an infinite number of calcareous ossicula,
arranged in regular series along the margins of the rays.
Each ray has a longitudinal furrow, perforated at the sides
by alternating rows of pores, through which tubular tentacula
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302"> 302 </a></span>
are protruded. The mouth is situated in the centre of
the under surface. Now if we imagine a Star-fish placed with
its mouth upwards, and the five rays fringed with long articulated
tentacula, as in the Comatula, and fixed by the centre
of its dorsal surface upon a jointed stem, we shall have the
essential characters of a crinoidean; and the animals of one
recent tribe of <i>Asteriad&aelig;</i> are actually in this condition in
the earlier stage of their existence: these are the <i>Comatul&aelig;</i>,
or Feather-stars, in some of which (the <i>Euryale</i>), the arms
are as numerously subdivided as in the Pentacrinites.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_290" id="Footnote_290"></a><a href="#FNanchor_290"><span class="label">[290]</span></a> The reader interested in this subject should peruse the charming
volume on British Star-fishes and other Echinoderms, by Professor
Edward Forbes. 1 vol. 8vo. John Van Voorst. 1841.</p></div>

<p>From the importance of the Crinoidea in the economy of
the ancient world, the history of the only type at present
inhabiting Europe, the ancient seas of which swarmed with
numerous forms of these beautiful creatures, presents many
points of interest. The receptacle of the soft body of the
<i>Comatula</i>, like that of the Crinoideans, consists of a cup-shaped
calcareous base, which sends off from its margin five
arms, that quickly subdivide, and are beset on each side with
rows of articulated pinn&aelig;; on the convexity there are also
numerous slender, jointed, simple, tentacula. The mouth
is situated in the centre of the area surrounded by the arms,
and is capable of being elongated into a proboscis. In the
young state, the Comatul&aelig; are attached by a jointed stem
to other bodies, as shown in <a href="#lign_91"><i>Lign.</i> 91</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1, which represents
several of the natural size; <i>fig.</i> 1<sup><i>a</i></sup> is an enlarged view
of an individual, and closely resembles an expanded Crinoidean.
The stem is composed of about eighteen joints, which
are pentangular; after a few weeks the Feather-star becomes
detached from its peduncle, and ranges the sea in freedom.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_291" id="Footnote_291"></a><a href="#FNanchor_291"><span class="label">[291]</span></a> The researches of J. V. Thompson, Esq. first brought to light
these interesting facts in the Natural History of the Comatula; this
eminent naturalist first observed pedunculated Comatul&aelig; in the Cove
of Cork. When this discovery was first made known to me, I suspected
that the <i>Marsupite</i> might have been pedunculated when young;
but as very small specimens of this Crinoid are equally free from all
traces of a stem as the adult, I was led to relinquish that opinion:
still the collector, when searching for Crinoidean remains, should
bear in mind the possibility of this having been the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303"> 303 </a></span></p></div>

<p>In the Comatulid&aelig;, the arms are distinct from the body;
these animals therefore closely approach the Crinoideans: in
the true Star-fish, the angular processes, or arms, are an integral
part of the body, containing a portion of the stomach,
ova, &amp;c., and are furnished with rows of pseudopodia.</p>

<p>Fossil Comatul&aelig; have been discovered in the Solenhofen
slate; and it is not improbable that some of the numerous
Crinoideans may be Asteriad&aelig; in the early stages of development.</p>

<p>In another group, Asteriad&aelig;, (named <i>Ophiur&aelig;</i> or Serpent-stars,)
the rays are long and slender, and without grooves or
tentacula, and are distinct from the body. These organs
are extremely flexuous, and in some species beset with spines,
and enable the animal to seize and entwine round its prey.
The mouth is central, and there is an ovarian aperture at
the base of each of the five arms.</p>

<p>Though the fossil Star-fishes comprise many extinct genera,
they belong to the same families as the recent; and Comatul&aelig;,
Ophiur&aelig;, and Asteriad&aelig;, occur in the Lias, Oolite, and
Chalk, in considerable numbers. Professor Edward Forbes
has determined many of the British species, and it is to be
hoped, will publish a monograph on the Fossil Asteriad&aelig;,
as a companion to his delightful work on the recent Star-fishes.</p>


<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL OSSICULA OF STAR-FISHES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Ossicula of Star-fishes.</span>&mdash;From the immense
number of little bones which enter into the composition of
the skeleton of a single Star-fish, and which are but slightly
held together after the death of the animal and the decomposition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304"> 304 </a></span>
of the soft parts, we can understand how layer upon
layer of ossicula of Asteriad&aelig; may have been formed at the
bottom of the cretaceous seas; as we find them in the quarries
near Arundel, Worthing, &amp;c. Whoever has witnessed the
hauling up of the dredge off our coasts, and seen the mass
of living Star-fishes which it brings up, as if the sea-bottom
were a living bank of these Radiata, will not be surprised
at the vast quantities of their fossil remains. This profusion
of the living animals of this family, serves also to
account for the enormous amount of those kindred but extinct
forms, whose relics were the subject of investigation in
the former part of the present chapter.</p>

<p>The ossicula vary in shape in different parts of the skeleton,
and Prof. E. Forbes affirms, that the careful determination
of their characters is of great importance, since they are
the only paints of the animals likely to be preserved, and the
shape of an ossicle is as truly indicative of a genus or species,
as is that of a bone among the vertebrata. There is one
ossicle situated on the side of the centre of the disk, which
is worthy of remark, because it often occurs in the chalk
mingled with the debris of the rest of the skeleton, and
should be preserved by the collector. It differs from all the
other bones in being marked with radiating grooves, and is
called the madreporiform tubercle; it appears to be the
analogue of the stem of the Crinoide&aelig;, in other words, a
rudimental condition of an organ, which is fully developed
in that order of radiata.</p>


<div class="sidenote">OPHIURA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ophiura.</span> <a href="#lign_97"><i>Lign. 97, fig. 1.</i></a>&mdash;Several species of this genus,
which is distinguished by the long, slender, serpent-like arms,
and the circular disk covered with plates and spines, have
been found in a fossil state: one species was discovered in
the Lower Silurian deposits by Prof. Sedgwick, and other
forms have been obtained from all the succeeding formations.
The Lias near Lyme Regis and Charmouth has yielded many

the Cretaceous formation, remains of several species have
been found. The first specimen from the Sussex Chalk that

my son, in a quarry at Preston, near Brighton; the rays were
admirably preserved, as shown in the portion figured in <i>Lign.</i>

<p>The detached ossicula of
the skeletons of Cushion-stars
are frequent in the
White Chalk; and the
large central bone, the
<i>madreporiform tubercle</i>,
which is present in the
dorsal aspect of all star-fishes,
is large, and therefore
often observed, and
may be easily mistaken
for the base of a crinoidean
receptacle. The layers in
the Sussex Chalk composed
of the exuvi&aelig; of
star-fishes, as previously
mentioned, are chiefly made up of ossicula of goniasters.</p>

<p>There are two species not uncommon in the Chalk, of
which portions may generally be obtained from the pits near
Gravesend; and occasionally very fine examples of the entire
goniaster are met with. Mr. Dixon's work contains figures
of several exquisite fossils of this kind. These organic remains
were familiar to the early collectors: Mr. Parkinson
figures several in Org. Rem. vol. iii. pl. i. and ii.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p><i>Goniaster Hunteri</i> (<a href="#lign_97"><i>Lign.</i> 97</a>), has the body obtusely pentagonal,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"> 307 </a></span>
coarsely mamillato-punctate; the ossicula of the disk hexagonal.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>

<p>Specimens of these Goniasters are sometimes met with
attached to a nodule of flint, in an extraordinary state of
freshness; sharp imprints of the external surface, the skeleton
having perished, are also found in flints, and, rarely, casts in
pyrites. The whetstone of Dorsetshire often bears distinct
moulds of Goniasters! I have found ossicula of this form of
Star-fish in the London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Asterias.</span> <a href="#lign_99"><i>Lign.</i> 99.</a>&mdash;The animals of this genus, of which
the common Star-fish is the type, are stellate in form; the
rays are flat, and extend from the body, of which they are a
prolongation&mdash;not mere appendages. They have deep grooves
or furrows bordered by marginal plates, which are continued
to the extremities.</p>

<p>The Lias of Germany has yielded several species of Asterias;
one of which is figured, <a href="#lign_99"><i>Lign.</i> 99</a>. A very large species
occurs in the Cornbrash of the Oolite of England. A magnificent
specimen of <i>Asterias arenicola</i> (Goldfuss), from the
calcareous grit, near Pickering, Yorkshire, measuring 10<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>

<div class="sidenote">GEOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF CRINOIDEA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological distribution of the Crinoidea.</span>&mdash;The great
number of extinct forms of this order of Radiata in the most
ancient fossiliferous deposits, is a remarkable fact, which has
already been incidentally adverted to. In the pal&aelig;ozoic
seas&mdash;including the Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and
Permian&mdash;the Crinoidea were represented by upwards of
fifty genera, whose existence began and ended during that
geological cycle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"> 309 </a></span></p>

<p>According to the present state of our knowledge all those
peculiar types of radiated animals were created, and each
lived through the destined period alloted to its race, and
died out ere the deposition of the New Red Sandstone; not
a single species, not a relic of the innumerable individuals
that swarmed in the pal&aelig;ozoic oceans, has been observed in
any strata above the Permian.</p>

<p>The Trias, which ranks as the earliest of the secondary
formations, is characterized by the advent of two typical
genera; the true Encrinus or Lily-encrinite, and the Pentacrinus;
the former is unknown in any other deposits; the
duration of its race was comprised within the Triassic epoch.
The Pentacrinus, on the other hand, has been perpetuated
through all the succeeding periods, and one species inhabits
the present seas; the sole existing representative of the most
ancient type of this order.</p>

<p>In the Oolite, another living form, the Comatula, first
appears.</p>

<p>The ocean of the Cretaceous epoch was inhabited by five
genera of Crinoids, unknown elsewhere; among them is that
remarkable genus, the Marsupite.</p>

<p>The Crinoidea of the Tertiary seas are as few in number
and variety as those of the present day; not a vestige of any
of the ancient tribes has been discovered. M. D'Orbigny's
<i>Tab.</i> 12 presents the phenomena thus briefly noticed, in a
striking point of view.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From this review of the fossil Crinoidea and Asteriad&aelig;,
the student will be in some measure prepared for the collecting
of instructive specimens from the immense accumulation of
remains imbedded in certain strata of the Oolitic, Liassic,
Carboniferous and Silurian rocks.</p>

<p>The British species of fossil Crinoidea amount to more
than two hundred, and when the great number of bones
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"> 310 </a></span>
that enter into the composition of the skeleton of a single
Pentacrinite or Encrinite is considered, the prodigious quantity
of the fossil remains of these zoophytes in the ancient
deposits may be readily conceived. Polished slices of the
encrinital marbles of Derbyshire, and of the Lias limestones
from Lyme Regis and Charmouth, should be obtained, as
they show sections of the imbedded crinoidal stems and
detached ossicula; and sometimes of the receptacles.</p>

<i>Jura limestone.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The fossils we have now to examine are among the most
familiar of the objects commonly known as petrifactions;
for as the enveloping cases of the Echini possess considerable
durability, they have served as moulds into which silex,
calc-spar, limestone, pyrites, and other mineral substances,
when in solution, or in a semi-fluid state, have percolated,
and formed sharp and enduring casts, which exhibit the
forms of the plates, and the disposition of the pores, stri&aelig;,
&amp;c. of the original structures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"> 312 </a></span></p>

<p>The common Echinus of our sea-coasts (<i>Echinus sph&aelig;ra</i>),
known by the name of Sea-egg, Sea-urchin, or Sea-hedgehog,
presents the typical characters of this order of Radiata,
which differs from the Crinoids and Star-fishes in the absence
of arms.</p>

<p>The calcareous envelope of the Echinus, or shell, as it is
popularly called, is composed of many calcareous, polygonal
plates, closely fitted to each other, and arranged in regular
and elegant patterns; appearing in the globular and spherical
kinds like the lines of the meridian on a globe. The
plates are disposed in ten vertical series, united by serrated
sutures, and form sections, into which the envelope or
case very commonly separates upon the decay of the investing
integuments. Of the ten bands five are large and five
small. The large bands (<i>are&aelig;</i>) are each composed of a double
row of plates, ornamented with tubercles supporting large
spines (<a href="#lign_100"><i>Lign.</i> 100</a>). The five narrower bands consist of much
smaller plates, and the spines are minute, or altogether wanting;
hence these bands appear like avenues through the
spinous tracks, and have therefore been fancifully termed
ambulacra or walks. They are the equivalents of the grooves
or furrows of the Star-fishes (<a href="#lign_108"><i>Lign.</i> 108, <i>a</i>.</a>); and are traversed
by numerous pores, for the exsertion of tubular feet,
or tentacula. Besides these rows of minute openings, there
are two principal apertures, the mouth and the outlet or
vent; and also a few large pores, commonly five, on the
summit, for the exclusion of the ova, and the free admission
of water.</p>

<p>The form and relative position of the parts above described,
afford characters by which the order is divided into
genera. The mouth, which is situated on the lower part, is
in some species furnished with five sharp angular teeth, attached
to a calcareous framework that admits of being protruded;
this apparatus, when entire, commonly bears the
name of "<i>Diogenes' lantern</i>." The eminences on the surface
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"> 313 </a></span>
of the plates vary in size from mere granules, or papill&aelig;, to
large mamillated tubercles; they serve for the attachment
of movable spines, which also present great variety of form
and ornament. The spines have a cup-like cavity at the
base which fits on the papill&aelig;, and in many species are only
supported by the capsular envelopment of the common integument;
but in others, the large spines are attached by a
ligament which passes from the centre of the socket, and is
received in a perforation of the papilla of each tubercle, in
the same manner as the <i>ligamentum teres</i> of the human thigh-bone.
Transverse slices of the spines exhibit the internal
structure, and are beautiful objects under the microscope.</p>

<p>There are also minute appendages to the integument,
called <i>pedicellari&aelig;</i>, or pinchers, of a very remarkable character,
whose functions are not known. They are slender
columnar bodies, each crowned with three calcareous teeth-like
spines, beautifully sculptured, and which in some species
are long and slender, in others short and obtuse. I have
not observed any traces of these bodies, even in the best
preserved echinites, but as they are as durable as the spines
and case, they may exist in a fossil state.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TURBAN ECHINITES.</div>

<p>This general view of the structure of the recent Echinites
will enable the student to understand the nature of the
fossil remains; for the parts above described, are found more
or less perfectly preserved, either in their natural arrangement,
or separated and dispersed in the rock. The habits
of these animals, of burrowing in the sand, were favourable
to their preservation in a mineralized state; and in some of
the oolitic limestones, hundreds of beautiful examples of
Turban Echinites (<i>Cidares</i>), having their spines spread out
on the face of the rock, are found lying in the positions they
evidently occupied when living. The quarries near Calne and
Chippenham, in Wilts, are celebrated for such fossils.</p>

<p>It was my intention to give figures of the genera into
which the numerous fossil species have been divided by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314"> 314 </a></span>
modern authors: but I found the attempt hopeless, from
the changes in nomenclature and arrangement which are
constantly taking place. The monographs on the fossil
Echinid&aelig;, by Prof. E. Forbes, now in course of publication
by the Government School of Mines, will, when completed,
place this branch of Pal&aelig;ontology on a satisfactory basis.</p>

<p>For the convenience of study, the fossil Echini may be
separated into three principal groups; viz. the <span class="smcap">Cidaritid&aelig;</span>,
or Turban Echinites; the <span class="smcap">Clypeasterid&aelig;</span>, or Buckler-shaped
Echinites; and the <span class="smcap">Spatangid&aelig;</span>, or Heart-shaped Echinites.</p>


<div class="sidenote">CIDARITID&AElig;.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cidaritid&aelig;.</span> <i>Turban Echinites.</i>&mdash;In these sea-urchins
the vent is situated on the summit of the shell, and is surrounded
by five minute apertures for the exclusion of the
ova. The mouth, or oral aperture, is placed directly opposite,
in the middle of the base, or inferior surface. The
mouth is large, and furnished with a powerful apparatus,
armed with teeth; which is sometimes found fossil (see
<a href="#lign_101"><i>fig.</i> 1, 3, <i>Lign.</i> 101</a>). The structure of the animal, in consequence
of the symmetrical position of the two chief outlets
of the shells, is strictly radiated; that is, all the parts proceed
from, or are arranged around one common centre. The
tubercles are larger and fewer than in the other tribes of this
family; they support long and powerful spines, which vary
much in form and ornament in different species (see <i>Lign.</i>
102). The larger tubercles and spines are beset with smaller
ones, disposed in regular series.</p>

<p>The Turban Echinites are the most ancient types of the
order, some forms appearing in the Carboniferous deposit.
The species are very numerous. The echinites of this group
are subdivided into four tribes:</p>

<p>1. <i>Cidares</i>, properly so called.&mdash;In these the tubercles are
perforated; the ambulacra narrow, and beset with granular
tubercles, and the two lines of pores are close together.
The pseudopodia can be protruded to a great length, even
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315"> 315 </a></span>
beyond the spines, so as to reach objects the latter could
not touch.</p>

<p>2. <i>Echini</i>, which differ from the above in the tubercles
being imperforate, and the ambulacral area wide: the spines
and tubes are of a moderate size.</p>

<p>3. <i>Diadem&aelig;.</i>&mdash;The tubercles are perforated, and the
ambulacra wide and studded with large tubercles.</p>

<p>4. <i>Saleni&aelig;.</i>&mdash;The tubercles are imperforate, and relatively
large; the chief distinction is a solid ovarian disk on
the summit, composed of several large flat plates, anchylosed
together.</p>

<p>The case of the Turban Echinites is composed of twenty
vertical series of plates, the ambulacra, or porous grooves,
forming continuous bands from the summit to the mouth,
which is armed with five angular teeth. This tribe comprises
many of the most elegant fossil species; those which, from
their shape and highly ornamented surface, have received
the popular name of Fairy's night-caps. The genus <i>Cidaris</i>,
which is characterized by perforated spinous tubercles,
affords the most beautiful examples, and these are occasionally
found with the spines in contact; a circumstance
less rare than might be supposed, when the nature of the
attachment of these organs is considered; for, upon the
decomposition of the integument, and the ligaments which
connect the spines with the tubercles in a living state,
these appendages quickly fall off, even in recent specimens.</p>

<p>The interesting fossil figured <a href="#lign_100"><i>Lign.</i> 100</a> (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_311">p. 311</a>.), is
a choice example of a Cidarite with the spines attached.
This species (<i>Hemicidaris crenularis</i>, <i>Agassiz</i>) is said to be
characteristic of the Upper Jura limestone of Switzerland,
and was supposed to be identical with Mr. Parkinson's
<i>Cidaris parpillata var.</i> (<i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. lvi. <i>fig.</i> 6), from Calne,
in Wiltshire; but spines like those of <a href="#lign_100"><i>Lign.</i> 100</a>, do not
occur in the English oolite. These spines are not homogeneous
throughout; the central part appears to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316"> 316 </a></span>
of a less dense tissue than the outer coat, as is shown in the
fractured spine in the figure. This structure does not exist
in the spines of the depressed Turban Echinites, but is stated
by M. Agassiz to prevail in all the species of the genus
<i>Hemicidaris</i>, of which the fossil figured in <a href="#lign_100"><i>Lign.</i> 100</a> is
the type.</p>

<p>Many species of Turban Echinites abound in the White
Chalk, especially near Gravesend, Northfleet, Purfleet, Charlton,
and other places in Kent; the softness of the cretaceous
strata in those localities rendering the removal of the

The spines are slender and annulated. Mr. Woodward
remarks that the common Chalk species referred by authors
to this genus, belong to the sub-genus <i>Cyphosoma</i> of M.
Agassiz, in which the tubercles are imperforate. There are
nearly fifty fossil species known, and they range from the

warm regions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Echinus.</span>&mdash;The shells of the genus Echinus resemble
those of Cidaris in their general structure, but the tubercles
are imperforate. More than twenty fossil species are described,
from the Oolite and Chalk.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salenia.</span>&mdash;In the greensand pits near Faringdon, in Berkshire,
which abound in fossil sponges and other porifer&aelig;
(<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>.), there are immense numbers of a small elegant
Turban Echinite, which belongs to the genus thus named by
the eminent zoologist. Dr. J. E. Gray, of the British Museum.
The collector will easily recognize these sea-urchins by the
plated summit. The shell has five ovarian and five interovarian
plates, and an eleventh or odd one. The tubercles
are crenulated. The common species at Faringdon is
<i>S. petalifera</i>, of Desmarest. Two species of this genus, viz.
<i>S. scutigera</i> and <i>S. stellulata</i>, from near Warminster, are
figured in <i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. liii. <i>fig.</i> 12, 13.</p>

<p><i>Cidarites of New Zealand.</i>&mdash;Detached plates and spines
of sea-urchins, belonging to the family Cidaritid&aelig;, have been
discovered by Mr. Walter Mantell, in the Ototara limestone
of New Zealand; which is a fawn-coloured stone, composed
of foraminifer&aelig;, like the Chalk, and containing terebratul&aelig;,
corals, and teeth of sharks.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>A fragment of a flint, impressed by a portion of a Cidarite,
is represented <a href="#lign_103"><i>Lign.</i> 103, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>. The perforations around
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321"> 321 </a></span>
the imprint indicate tubular cavities in the flinty formed
by the spines, and show that these processes were attached
to the shell when the latter was enveloped by the fluid silex;
the case and the spines having since perished. But in the
Chalk, exquisite specimens of Cidarites occur with the case
perfect, and filled with flint: examples of this kind are often
attached to a nodule by the slender column of silex that
fills up the aperture of the shell. The mineralized condition
of the originally friable calcareous cases of Cidarites
and other Echini, is worthy of attention: for whether the
shell or spines be imbedded in chalk, flint, or pyrites, if the
structure and form remain, the constituent substance is
invariably opaque crystallized carbonate of lime, having an
oblique fracture.</p>

<p>As this conversion of a crustaceous envelope into calc-spar
is constant, it has probably resulted from the peculiar
nature of the original animal structures; but the cause of
such transmutation is unknown.</p>


<div class="sidenote">CIDARITID&AElig; OF THE PAL&AElig;OZOIC ROCKS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Cidaritid&aelig; of the Pal&aelig;ozoic Rocks.</span>&mdash;Three genera of
this family, comprising several species, have been discovered
in the carboniferous limestone of Northumberland and Ireland.
One genus is undistinguishable from Cidaris; and
the species are placed under that name in Mr. Morris's Cat.
Brit. Foss.</p>

<p>These fossils have been figured and described by Prof.
John Phillips, and Col. Portlock. Prof. M'Coy, with his
accustomed penetration and sagacity, has ascertained, that
notwithstanding the general resemblance between the Cidarites
of the secondary and those of the pal&aelig;ozoic formations,
the latter are constructed on an entirely different plan. In
the turban echini of the secondary, tertiary, and modern
seas, the interambulacral plates always consist of <i>two</i> rows;
but in the pal&aelig;ozoic Cidarites there are <i>three</i> or some greater
odd number of these plates. This eminent naturalist, therefore,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322"> 322 </a></span>
places the earliest type of Echinid&aelig; at present known
in the order <i>Perischoechinid&aelig;</i>. The case is spheroidal, formed
of more than twenty rows of plates; five ambulacra composed
of two rows of pentagonal plates each; rows of interambulacral
plates, three, five, or more, terminating dorsally
in five large pentagonal ovarian plates.</p>

<p>As in the more recent forms, these Cidarites are separable
into two groups or families; one in which the spiniferous
tubercles are imperforate as in the Echinus (<i>Pal&aelig;chinid&aelig;</i>
of M'Coy); the other with numerous small secondary tubercles
and a few large primary ones, perforated for the
ligament of the spine as in Cidaris (the <i>Arch&aelig;ocidarid&aelig;</i> of
M'Coy).<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clypeastrid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;The shell in this family of sea-urchins,
is oblong or rounded; the mouth is of an angular form, and
situated in the middle of the base or inferior face; it is
furnished with well-developed dental organs. The outlet is
distant from the summit. The tubercles are mere granulations,
and the spines proportionally small. This group is
subdivided into two tribes: the <span class="smcap">Galeritid&aelig;</span> (<i>helmet-like</i>),
and the <span class="smcap">Clypeide&aelig;</span> (<i>buckler-like</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Galerites albo-galerus.</span> <a href="#lign_104"><i>Lign.</i> 104.</a>&mdash;The tribe of which
this genus is the type has the shell inflated, orbicular, oblong,
or pentangular. The ambulacra are simple, never petaloid;
the poriferous zones extend uninterruptedly from the
summit to the mouth.</p>

<p>In the species figured <a href="#lign_104"><i>Lign.</i> 104, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>, the shell is of a
conical form, in some varieties subpentagonal; narrowest
at the hinder part. The mouth is of a decagonal shape, and
armed with teeth: it is situated in the centre of the base
(<a href="#lign_104"><i>Lign.</i> 104, fig, 1<sup><i>a</i></sup></a>); the outlet is near the posterior margin
of the base. The surface of the shell is covered with granulations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323"> 323 </a></span>
irregularly distributed. This species, which received
the name of <i>albo-galerus</i>, from its fancied resemblance
to the white conical caps of the priests of Jupiter, occurs in
great numbers and perfection in the Kentish chalk; it is less
common in that of Sussex. Siliceous casts of the shell are
constantly found among the drift and gravel, and on the
ploughed lands of chalk districts; they are popularly termed
"<i>sugar-loaves</i>." The specimens obtained from the chalk,
when filled with flint, yield exquisite casts, if the shell be
dissolved in dilute hydrochloric acid; by this means the
form of the plates, and casts of the minutest ambulacral
pores are obtained.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Clypeide&aelig;</span> differ from the tribe of echinites last
described, in the ambulacra being petaloid, that is, of a leaf-like
shape, and disposed in a stellated figure on the upper
part of the shell. The ambulacra do not extend to the
mouth. The shell is generally of a depressed form; and the
petaloid ambulacra in many species appear like an elegant
star, richly fretted, spread over the shell. There are numerous
species of this type, both recent and fossil; many of
the latter, being of a large size, are beautiful objects in a
cabinet of petrifactions.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Clypeus sinuatus</span> (<i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. liv. <i>fig.</i> 1).&mdash;Of this
genus, which is the type of the tribe, a large species, <i>C.
sinuatus</i>, is very common in the Oolite of Wilts, Gloucestershire,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326"> 326 </a></span>
and Oxfordshire, and must be familiar to collectors.
The shell is circular, and much depressed; and has five
petaloid ambulacra: the odd interambulacral area forms a
deep furrow in which the outlet is situated: the mouth is
median, pentagonal, and surrounded by a strong margin.
The coloured figures in <i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. liv. will enable the
student to recognize these fossils without difficulty. Splendid
specimens of an allied form (<i>Clypeaster</i>) occur in the tertiary
limestone of Malta, (<i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. lvi. fig. 7,) and are not
uncommon in collections.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Nucleolites</span> (<i>Wond.</i> p. 328).&mdash;There is a small type
belonging to this family, of which several species are so
abundant in the Oolite, Greensand, and Chalk-marl, that a
brief notice of their characters may be useful. The shell is
oblong and inflated, rounded in front and flat behind. The
pores are united by grooves; the outlet is in a deep furrow
on the superior face; the mouth is sub-central. One species
occurs in the Tertiary strata, and there is a recent species
inhabits the seas of Australia. There are coloured figures of
Nucleolites in <i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. liv. fig. 5, pl. lv. figs. 6, 8.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Spatangid&aelig;.</span>&mdash;In this tribe of echinites, the case is oblong
or cordiform. The mouth, elongated transversely and destitute
of proper jaws, is situated in front of the centre of the
base, near the anterior border of the periphery. The outlet
is towards the posterior margin. The tubercles and spines
are very small. Four subdivisions are established, namely,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <i>Ananchytes</i>.&mdash;A thick and oval shell; the ambulacra
simple and converging towards the summit; the mouth
transverse; the outlet is situated on the inferior face. (<i>Lign.</i>
104, <i>fig.</i> 2.)</p>

<p>2. <i>Spatangus.</i>&mdash;This name is now restricted to those
Spatangid&aelig; in which the ambulacra are petaloid, the external
row of pores slightly elongated, and the inner rows round.</p>

<p>3. <i>Micraster.</i>&mdash;By this term are now distinguished the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327"> 327 </a></span>
Spatangid&aelig; which have the ambulacra depressed, and the
shell cordiform. The pores of the even ambulacra are
united by a furrow. The vent is on the posterior face. The
common chalk Spatangus belongs to this genus. (<a href="#lign_107"><i>Lign.</i>
107.</a>)</p>

<p>4. <i>Holaster.</i>&mdash;The shells are heart-shaped; the ambulacra
simple, and converging towards the summit; the mouth is
transverse; the outlet is within the posterior face.</p>


<div class="sidenote">ANANCHYTES OVATUS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ananchytes ovatus.</span> <a href="#lign_104"><i>Lign.</i> 104.</a> <i>fig.</i> 2.&mdash;These sea urchins
are among the most characteristic of the fossils of the Upper
Chalk, and are peculiar to the Cretaceous formation. They
are readily distinguished by their elevated helmet-like form,
and by the transverse mouth and oblong outlet situated on
the inferior face of the flat base, and towards the margin.
(<a href="#lign_104"><i>Lign.</i> 104. <i>fig.</i> 2<sup><i>a</i></sup>.</a>)</p>

<p>The vernacular names of "<i>Shepherd's Crown</i>," and "<i>Fairy
Loaf</i>," indicate the form of these abundant fossils. The
shell is oval in its longest diameter; flat, or nearly so,
below; and rounded, conical, and somewhat laterally compressed
towards the summit. The ambulacra are five,
between double lines of pores; the tubercles are minute
and scattered; the substance of the shell is of great thickness.
More than twenty species of the genus are known.</p>

<p>The helmet Echinites, like the preceding, have given rise
to innumerable siliceous casts, which are found associated
with those of other forms in the Drift, on the ploughed
lands, and among the shingle on the sea-shore; they are
often placed as ornaments on the mantel-shelves of the
cottagers. A flint cast of an Ananchyte, in which the plates
were partially separated, is represented <a href="#lign_103"><i>Lign.</i> 103, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>.
The shells are sometimes filled with pyrites; and occasionally
are found partially empty, with crystals of calc-spar symmetrically
arranged on the inside of the shell, parallel with the
rows of ambulacral pores. <a href="#lign_103"><i>Lign.</i> 103, <i>fig.</i> 3</a>, is a remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328"> 328 </a></span>

the upper surface is lined with crystals of calcareous spar.</p>

wider before than behind, with a sulcus, or furrow,
in front. The shell is fragile, and composed of large
polygonal plates; the tubercles small and irregularly distributed;
the spines are short. The mouth is transverse,
situated anteriorly, and protected by a strong projection of
the odd interambulacrum, which is named the lip. The
vent is terminal, and placed above the margin. There are
but four ambulacra, and these are incomplete, comparatively
of small extent, and situated in deep furrows. A large and
new species of Micraster (<i>M. cor-bovis</i>, of Prof. E. Forbes),
from the Sussex Chalk, is figured in Dixon's <i>Fossils</i>, pl. xxiv.

<p><span class="smcap">Toxaster</span> (<i>Spatangus</i>) <span class="smcap">complanatus</span>. <a href="#lign_108"><i>Lign.</i> 108.</a>&mdash;In
this form of Spatangus (constituting the genus <i>Toxaster
Agass</i>.), the ambulacra are not depressed or furrowed, as in
the preceding echinites, nor petaloid (<i>leaf-shaped</i>), as in
those which M. Agassiz denominates true Spatangi, but converge
to a point on the summit, as is shown in <i>fig.</i> 2; the
external rows of pores are elongated horizontally, and form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330"> 330 </a></span>
a kind of furrow. The odd ambulacrum is in a deep groove.
The mouth is transverse, <i>fig.</i> 3, <i>d</i>; and at the anterior part
of the inferior face there is a depression, which results from
the convergence of the ambulacral are&aelig; towards that point.
The vent is in the posterior face. This species is from the
<i>Neocomian</i> strata of France; I introduce it to illustrate the
characters of several other echinites, which the French geologists
suppose to be confined to the so-called Neocomian
formation; but which also occur in the Upper Greensand
of Blackdown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Holaster</span> is another genus of Spatangid&aelig; established by
M. Agassiz, for those echinites that are heart-shaped, with
simple ambulacra converging towards the summit. The
mouth is elongated transversely; the outlet is on the posterior
face. A specimen first described in my <i>Foss. S. D.</i> (<i>pl.</i>
xvii. <i>fig.</i> 9, 21), as Spatangus planus, is common in the
Lower Chalk, and Chalk-marl, and abundant in the Firestone
Malm-rock.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Our limits will not allow of a more extended notice of
the fossil <i>Echinid&aelig;</i>. The student should consult the Memoirs
on the genera, now in course of publication at the
Government School of Mines, by Professor Edward Forbes;
the plates are exquisite, as works of art, and the descriptions
all that can be desired.</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon's work contains three excellent plates of cretaceous
Echinites. Several chalk species are figured in my Foss.
South Down. The numerous coloured figures of fossil sea-urchins
in the Pictorial Atlas of Organic Remains, have
already been mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Distribution of Echinites.</span>&mdash;No vestiges of
this order of radiata have been discovered in the Silurian
deposits: the earliest known occurrence of any type is in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331"> 331 </a></span>
Carboniferous formation. The most ancient Echinid&aelig;, according
to the present state of our knowledge, are the Cidares,
in the modified form previously noticed,&mdash;<i>Arch&aelig;ocidarid&aelig;</i>
(<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_322">p. 322</a>.).</p>

<p>In the Trias another type appears, <i>Hemicidaris</i>, which
holds an intermediate place between the Cidarites properly
so called and the Diadema.</p>

<p>In the Oolite, and Jurassic formations, numerous forms are
for the first time met with, constituting the genera Echinus,
<i>Clypeus</i>, <i>Disaster</i>, <i>Holectypus</i>, Diadema, Nucleolites, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The Cretaceous seas swarmed with echini belonging to
genera of which no traces have been found in earlier rocks;
viz. Holaster, <i>Salenia</i>, <i>Micraster</i>, Salerites, Discoidea, <i>Ananchytes</i>,
Cassidulus, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the Tertiary formations, Spatangus, Scutella, Clypeaster,
and other new genera appear, and many of the ancient
ones are absent; or at least have not been observed. Of
the genera printed above in italics, no living species are
known.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON COLLECTING FOSSIL ECHINODERMATA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On collecting and developing fossil Echinodermata.</span>&mdash;In
the previous remarks on the fossil remains of radiated
animals, we have pointed out those remains that are the
most important and instructive, and should be sought for
by the student. Thus, in collecting Crinoids, the receptacle
or body should be the principal object of research, and if
only detached plates can be extracted from the rock, their
relative position should be carefully noted, and the specimens
glued to a card or board, in their natural order; and some
of the ossicula of the column, and of the arms, or tentacula,
be placed with them.</p>

<p>Mr. Miller dissected specimens of every genus, and has
figured the separate plates or bones that enter into the composition
of the receptacle,<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and arms. Traces of the tentacula,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332"> 332 </a></span>
and their subdivisions, must be sought for, and if
discovered, should be removed with the stone to which they
are attached, and the block be afterwards reduced in size by
a mason's saw, and not by the blows of a hammer, which
might displace the ossicula.</p>

<p>If imbedded in Lias shale, or other fragile material, a
thick slab should be removed, for greater safety in conveyance;
this, when reduced to a convenient size and thinness,
may be imbedded in a tray with plaster of Paris, or glued
to a piece of thin, well-seasoned mahogany, or deal. The
specimens of the <i>Pear Encrinite</i> of Bradford, and of the
Pentacrinites from Lyme Regis, in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a>
were prepared in this manner.</p>

<p>The crinoideal remains in Chalk belong but to few genera;
they merely require the usual manipulation of cretaceous
fossils. The collector, however, should remember that the
ossicula and plates of the receptacle (as for instance of the
<i>Marsupites</i>), are but slightly adherent to each other, and the
chalk must not be wholly removed, or these parts will become
detached.</p>

<p>The receptacles of the Apiocrinites of the chalk are rarely
found with more than a few joints of the column attached;
and I believe no vestiges of the arms have been observed:
these parts are therefore desiderata, and should be diligently
sought for: the radicles of these crinoideans are long, articulated,
and branching, and without due caution may be mistaken
for the arms, or for another species. The first remark
will also apply to the Marsupite; any specimens with but a
few ossicula of the arms are very precious. I may observe
that there is yet much to learn as to the number of species
and genera, and the peculiar characters of the Crinoidea of
the chalk, and that any addition to our knowledge on this
subject will be valuable.</p>

<p>The <i>Asterid&aelig;</i> are so simple in form and structure, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333"> 333 </a></span>
is unnecessary to offer any suggestions for their development;
of course they must not be removed from the stone.</p>

<p>Among the detached ossicula dispersed through the chalk,
the student will remember that the large <i>madrepore-like</i>
tubercle of the Star-fishes, (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_304">p. 304</a>.,) may often occur.
It may easily be mistaken for an encrinital body, or for a
coral, but an accurate inspection will show that it is not
composed of anchylosed plates, like the receptacle of an
Apiocrinite, but has surfaces for attachment to other ossicula;
while the ends, which in a crinoideal column would
have radiated surfaces, are rounded and entire.</p>

<p>In collecting Echinites, much caution is required in dissecting
specimens surrounded by spines. If imbedded in
hard limestone, or in laminated clay, it is scarcely possible
to preserve the spines in connexion with the shell; but it
often happens that the Cidarites of the Oolite are attached
by the base to the solid limestone, and the case with the
spines is imbedded in sandy, friable aggregate, not difficult
of removal. A specimen in my cabinet, with upwards of
fifty spines attached to the shell, was obtained under such
circumstances.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_304" id="Footnote_304"></a><a href="#FNanchor_304"><span class="label">[304]</span></a> Now in the British Museum.</p></div>

<p>The Chalk Echinites will be found to possess spines more
frequently than is commonly supposed, if care be taken to
explore the surrounding chalk before it be removed. T have
often procured Cidarites with spines, when there were no
apparent vestiges of these appendages, by carefully scraping
away the surrounding mass until the extremity of a spine
appeared, and then tracing it up to its connexion with the
shell; another point was discovered by further removal, and
that was developed in the same manner; and at length a
Cidaris with several spines was obtained. The chalk around
the mouth should always be cautiously removed in the dentated
species, in the hope of preserving the teeth, as in the
specimens, <a href="#lign_101"><i>Lign.</i> 101, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>, and <a href="#lign_104"><i>Lign.</i> 104, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334"> 334 </a></span></p>

<p>As the shells of Chalk Echinites, when hollow, are often
lined with crystals (see <a href="#lign_103"><i>Lign.</i> 103, <i>fig.</i> 3</a>), it is worth
while to break all indifferent specimens of the common
species, with the chance of obtaining an example of this
kind.</p>

<p>The chalk must not be <i>scraped off</i> from the crust or
shell of the Echinites, or the minute granulations and papill&aelig;
will be injured or removed; it should be flaked off
with a blunt point.</p>

<p>In friable arenaceous strata, as in some of the Maestricht
and Tertiary deposits, the Echinites may be extricated in as
perfect a condition as if fresh from the sea; it is, indeed,
probable, from the habit of these animals of burrowing in
mud and sand, that in many instances they were entombed
alive by the sediment in which their fossil remains are
imbedded.</p>

<p>Beautiful Cidarites and their spines may be collected in
the Oolitic strata at Calne, Chippenham, Bath, &amp;c.; and in
the coralline Oolite near Faringdon; and of Saleni&aelig;, in the
Greensand gravel-pits near that town.</p>

<p>The Upper Greensand near Warminster, and at Chute
Farm, near Heytesbury, abounds in small Cidaritid&aelig; and
other echinites. The large sinuated Clypeus is found in
great perfection in the Oolite at Malton, Cheltenham, Gloucester,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The cretaceous echinites are to be met with in most localities
of the white chalk. The chalk-pits in Kent, especially
at Gravesend, Northfleet, Chatham, &amp;c. are rich in Cidarites,
and their spines. The Galerites, and Ananchytes, are also
very fine and numerous; and the softness of the chalk renders
their extrication from the stone a delightful task for the
young geologist.</p>

<p>Specimens of the common kinds of fossil Echinoderms
may be obtained at moderate prices of the dealers named in
the Appendix.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335"> 335 </a></span></p>

<p>There is a matchless suite of fossil Echinid&aelig; in the
British Museum, which has been arranged and named by
Mr. S. P. Woodward, and is now the most instructive and
interesting collection extant. It contains examples of the
following genera, viz., Ananchytes, Echinocorys, Echinolampas,
Holaster, Galerites, Cidaris, Diadema, Acrosalenia,
Glypticus, Disaster, Pygurus, Clypeaster, Scutella, Salmasis,
Echinocyanus, &amp;c. There is also a good series of echinital
spines.</p>

regions,&mdash;and that the most stupendous monuments
erected by man are constructed of the petrified relics of
beings invisible to the unassisted eye,&mdash;are facts not the
least astounding of those which modern Geology has revealed.</p>

<p>This interesting field of research, which the labours of that
eminent observer M. Ehrenberg first made known, has since
been explored by other naturalists, and in every part of the
world many of the Tertiary and Secondary deposits have been
found to contain microscopic organisms in profusion. At present
this branch of pal&aelig;ontology is in its infancy, and it offers
to the young student an inexhaustible and most attractive
path of scientific investigation; it possesses, too, this great
advantage over many others, that it can be pursued at home,
and the materials for its prosecution are everywhere at hand.
Unlike my explorations in the Wealden, in which a few
fragments of bones, or teeth, scattered at wide intervals

often the only reward of a day's labour, here, in the quiet of

of chalk, picked up by the road-side, the fossil remains of
beings as interesting and extraordinary as the extinct colossal
reptiles of Tilgate Forest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MICROPHYTES.</div>

<p>The microphytes, or fossil Diatomace&aelig;, described in a
previous chapter, (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_93">p. 93</a>.,) were formerly classed with
the organisms that now claim our attention, under the name
<i>Infusoria</i>; from the belief that generally prevailed among
naturalists, of their animal origin. In fact, some eminent
microscopic observers, while admitting the vegetable character
of Xanthidium, Micrasterias, &amp;c. consider the Navicul&aelig;,
Ennoti&aelig;, &amp;c. as belonging to the animal kingdom.</p>

<p>Thus Dr. J, W. Bailey, in a late "Memoir on the Microscopic
Organisms in Various Localities of the United States,"
divides these bodies into three groups; viz. <i>Infusoria</i>, <i>Desmidie&aelig;</i>,
and <i>Diatomace&aelig;</i>; with the remark, that he has separated
the two latter tribes from the Infusoria, because so
many distinguished naturalists consider them decidedly to
belong to the vegetable kingdom: "but," he adds, "while
I believe that no positive line of separation can be drawn
between certain animals and vegetables, I am yet disposed
to regard the <i>Desmidie&aelig;</i>, from the sum of all their characters,
as most nearly allied to admitted vegetables; while the
<i>Diatomace&aelig;</i>, notwithstanding Mr. Thwaites's interesting observations
on their conjunction,<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> still seem to me, as they
have always done, to be true animals. There is such apparent
volition in their movements, such an abundance of
nitrogen in the composition of their soft parts, and such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338"> 338 </a></span>
resemblance between the stipitate Gomphonemat&aelig; and some
of the Vorticell&aelig;, that I should be still disposed to class
them as animals, even if Ehrenberg's observations of the
retractile threads and snail-like feet of some of the Navicul&aelig;
should not be confirmed."<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_305" id="Footnote_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_305"><span class="label">[305]</span></a> The mode of fructification, or <i>conjunction</i>, as it is termed, in the
Alg&aelig;, consists in the adhesion of two cells or frustules together, and
their fusion into one; from their united contents a mass of granular
substance is produced, that becomes consolidated and forms the
spore or fruit, which, when arrived at maturity, is set free by the
bursting of the cell. Mr. Thwaites has ascertained that the fructification
is similar in the Diatomace&aelig;.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_306" id="Footnote_306"></a><a href="#FNanchor_306"><span class="label">[306]</span></a> Smithsonian Contributions, vol. ii. p. 34.</p></div>

<p>Thus, whilst referring Closterium, Arthrodesma, Euastrum,
Xanthidium, Micrasterium, &amp;c. as vegetables, to the Desmidie&aelig;,
Dr. Bailey places, <i>Actinocyclus</i>, <i>Campilodiscus</i>, <i>Coscinodiscus</i>,
<i>Ennotia</i>, <i>Navicula</i>, <i>Gomphonema</i>, <i>Pinnularia</i>, <i>Triceratium</i>,
&amp;c. among the Diatomace&aelig;, as animals.</p>

<p>Of the animal nature of the microscopic objects which
now require our attention, there is however no question,
although the zoological position and affinities of many of
the organisms included in this survey are still but imperfectly
determined.</p>

<p>The animals designated <i>Foraminifera</i>,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> or Rhizopoda,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a>
are of a more simple structure than the Polypifera and
Echinodermata described in the previous chapters; yet as
their relics are for the most part presented to the notice of
the geologist as aggregations of shells, forming extensive beds
of limestone, it will be convenient to treat of them in this
place.</p>

<p>The fact that the fossil remains of Foraminifera, and
of <i>Mollusca</i>, alike consist of shells, and constitute strata
identical in mineral characters, and deposited under like
physical conditions, renders the examination of these Microzoa<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a>
a fit introduction to the study of the durable remains
of the higher order&mdash;the Mollusca.</p>

only be defined by the aid of the microscope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339"> 339 </a></span></p></div>

<p>It is scarcely more than a hundred and twenty years ago,
that the existence of this numerous order of microzoa was
first made known to naturalists by <i>Beccarius</i>, who detected
a considerable number of species in the sand on the shores
of the Adriatic. But the structure of the animals that
secreted these shells is a discovery of comparatively modern
date. The early collectors classed these microscopic bodies
with the shells of true mollusca; and even M. D'Orbigny,
whose elaborate researches justly constitute him a high
authority in this branch of natural history, in his first
memoir, in 1825, described the involuted discoidal forms as
Cephalopoda. This error was corrected by the investigations
of M. Dujardin, who in 1835 satisfactorily demonstrated
that the Foraminifera are animals of the most simple structure,
and entirely separated by their organization from the
Mollusca.</p>

<p>But the true nature of this class is so little understood by
British collectors of fossil shells,&mdash;of course I mean the
uninitiated, and the amateur naturalist, for whose use these
unpretending pages are designed,&mdash;that in order to invest
the study of the fossil species with the interest which a knowledge
of the structure and economy of the living originals
can alone impart, I must give a history of the recent forms
somewhat in detail, taking M. D'Orbigny as my chief
authority.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FORAMINIFERA.</div>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Foraminifera</span> are marine animals of low organization,
and, with but few exceptions, extremely minute: in an ounce
of sea-sand between three and four millions have been distinctly
enumerated. When living, they are not aggregated,
but always individually distinct; they are composed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340"> 340 </a></span>
a body, or vital mass, of a gelatinous consistence, which is
either entire and round, or divided into segments, placed
either on a simple or alternate line, or coiled in a spiral, or
involuted round an axis. This body is covered with an
envelope or shell, which is generally testaceous, rarely cartilaginous,
is modelled on the segments, and follows all the
modifications of form and contour of the body. From the
extremity of the last segment there issue sometimes from
one, sometimes from several openings of the shell, or through
the numerous pores or foramina, very elongated, slender,
contractile, colourless, filaments, more or less divided and
ramified, serving for prehension, and capable of entirely
investing the shell.</p>

<p>The body varies in colour, but is always identical in individuals
of the same species; it is yellow, ochreous, red,
violet, blue, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Its consistence is variable; it is composed of minute globules,
the aggregation of which determines the general tint.
It is sometimes entire, round, and without segments, as in
<i>Gromia</i>, <i>Orbulina</i>, &amp;c., which represent at all ages the
embryonic state of all the other genera. The animal increases
by gemmation, each segment being essentially distinct,
but connected with the preceding one by a tube or neck.
When the body is divided by lobes or segments, the primary
lobe, as in the permanent condition of the Gromia, is at first
round or oval, according to the genus; once formed it never
enlarges, but is enveloped externally by testaceous matter.</p>

<p>The segments, which successively appear, are agglomerated
together in seven different ways, and these modifications are
the basis of M. D'Orbigny's classification. The discoidal
forms, as the <i>Rotalia</i>, <i>Rosalina</i>, <i>Cristellaria</i>, &amp;c. are involute,
like the Nautilus, and divided by septa or partitions, which,
like the enveloping shell, are perforated. The lobes of the
body <i>occupy contemporaneously every chamber</i>, and are connected
by a tube that extends through the entire series. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341"> 341 </a></span>
the spiral form, as the Textularia, &amp;c., the same structure is
apparent.</p>

<p>Whatever the form of the body, the filaments always consist
of a colourless transparent matter; they are capable of
being elongated to six times the diameter of the shell. They
often divide and subdivide, so as to appear branched; and
though alike in form in the different genera, vary much
in their position. In some species they form a bundle which
issues from a single aperture, and is withdrawn into the
same by contraction; in others, the filaments project only
through each of the pores in that portion of the shell which
covers the last segment: in many they issue from both the
large aperture and the foramina. These filaments or pseudopodia
fulfil in these animals the functions of the numerous
tentacula in the Star-fishes; serving as instruments of locomotion
and attachment.</p>

<p>Neither organs of nutriment nor of reproduction have
been discovered. In the genera having one large aperture
from which the filaments issue and retract, we can conceive
nutriment to be absorbed by that opening; but this cannot
be the case in the species which have the last cell closed up;
in these the filaments issuing through the foramina are
probably also organs of nutrition. M. D'Orbigny considers
the Foraminifera as constituting a distinct class in zoology;
though less complicated than the Echinoderms and the
Polypifera in their internal organization, they have the mode
of locomotion of the first; while by their free, individual existence,
they are more advanced in the scale of being than the
aggregated and immovably fixed animals of the latter class.</p>

<p>But though I consider the animal of the Foraminifera as
single, and the additional lobes, or segments, as the continuous
growth of the same individual, I must state that
some eminent naturalists regard the entire structure as a
series of distinct individuals, developed by gemmation from
the first formed segment, like the clusters of the compound
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342"> 342 </a></span>
<i>Tunicata</i>; and not as a single aggregated organism, made
up of an assemblage of similar parts indefinitely repeated.
In a pal&aelig;ontological point of view, it matters not which
opinion is adopted.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CLASSIFICATION OF THE FORAMINIFERA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification of the Foraminifera.</span>&mdash;The number of
genera is so great, that I can only attempt to convey a very
general idea of the principles of classification adopted by
M. D'Orbigny, and give a few illustrations of some of the
most abundant fossil species.</p>

<p>That the reader may be cognizant of the usual aspect of
these shells five specimens from the Chalk, belonging to as
many genera, are here represented (<a href="#lign_109"><i>Lign.</i> 109</a>); the deposit
whence they were obtained will be described hereafter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343"> 343 </a></span></p>

<p>As the mode in which the growth of the body, and consequently
of the shell, takes place, differs greatly in certain
groups, an obvious and natural arrangement is suggested, by
which the class is divided into seven orders:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The primary, or simplest type; one segment or cell;
as in <i>Orbulina</i>.</p>

<p>2. The segments arranged in circular lines; as in <i>Orbitolina</i>.</p>

<p>3. Segments disposed in a straight or arched single line;
successively increasing from the first to the last cell; as in
<i>Nodosaria</i>, <a href="#lign_111"><i>Lign.</i> 111</a>.</p>

<p>4. Segments, spirally and discoidally disposed, on the
same plane, like cells of the Nautilus; as in <i>Cristellaria</i>,
<a href="#lign_109"><i>Lign.</i> 109</a>.</p>

<p>The same type, but coiled obliquely, and inequilaterally,
like the shells of Gasteropoda; as in <i>Globigerina</i>, <a href="#lign_109"><i>Lign.</i> 109</a>,
<i>Rosalina</i>, <a href="#lign_109"><i>Lign.</i> 109</a>.</p>

<p>5. Segments developed alternately on the right and left
of the first, and successively on each side the longitudinal
axis; as in <i>Textularia</i>, <a href="#lign_109"><i>Lign.</i> 109</a>.</p>

<p>6. Arrangement of the segments combining the modes
of 4 and 5; that is, the segments are formed alternately, but
the whole are coiled spirally, either obliquely, or on the
same plane; as in <i>Amphistigena</i>.</p>

<p>7. Segments round a common axis, on two, three, four,
or five, opposite faces, returning after each entire revolution;
the new cells being placed exactly on the preceding
series; as in <i>Quinqueloculina</i>, <i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. lxii. <i>fig.</i> 12.</p>

<p>The Foraminifera vary considerably in magnitude; by far
the greater number of species are invisible to the unassisted
eye, and the aid of a lens or microscope is required to define
the structure even of the largest; yet many are of sufficient
size to be recognized, as for example the <i>Spirolin&aelig;</i>, <i>Lign.</i>
112. A few genera are from a quarter of an inch to nearly
an inch in diameter, as the <i>Orbitoides Mantelli</i> of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344"> 344 </a></span>
tertiary formations of North America,<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> and the <i>Nummulina</i>,
commonly termed <i>Nummulites</i>, of Europe, <a href="#lign_110"><i>Lign.</i> 110</a>.</p>

<p>We will now describe the genera selected for illustration,
commencing with the large and well-known type, whose
aggregated remains form extensive beds of crystalline limestone
in the Alps, and in Asia, and Africa.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

or lenticular form, composed of numerous cells, concentrically
arranged round an axis on the same plane; both
sides of the disk covered by a smooth thick plate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NUMMULITES.</div>

<p>Under the name of <i>Nummulites</i>, from their resemblance
to a piece of money, the fossil shells of this genus of Foraminifera
have long been known to naturalists, and are figured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345"> 345 </a></span>
in many of the early works on petrifactions. They occur
in immense quantities in certain rocks, and are of all sizes,
from a mere point, to disks an inch and a half in diameter;
thus exceeding in magnitude all other animals of this class.</p>

<p>Perfect specimens appear as a calcareous solid circular
body, of a lenticular shape; smooth, and slightly convex on
both sides, and without any visible structure. On splitting
the fossil transversely, or rubbing down one of the convex
planes, a series of minute cells, arranged in a discoidal spire,
is brought to view, as shown in <a href="#lign_110"><i>Lign.</i> 110, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>. But this
description gives a very inadequate idea of the complicated
and exquisite structure of the original, which has been
admirably worked out by Dr. Carpenter. This eminent
physiologist has shown that each chamber was occupied by
a living segment, connected with other segments by one or
more tubular prolongations, which absorbed nutrition from
without, by means of filamentous pseudopodia, that projected
through a system of passages leading from the medial plane
to the external surface.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> A figure of the supposed form of
a living Nummulina is given in Pict. Atlas, p. 187.</p>

<p>The specimens figured in <a href="#lign_110"><i>Lign.</i> 110</a> are from the limestone
that forms the foundation rock of the Great Pyramid
of Egypt, and of which that structure is in great part composed.
Strabo alludes to the Nummulites of the Pyramids,
as lentils which had been scattered about by the artificers
employed on those stupendous monuments, and become
stone.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> Silicified masses of Nummulites are occasionally
met with; polished slices of such specimens are richly figured
by the sections of the inclosed Foraminifera.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_315" id="Footnote_315"></a><a href="#FNanchor_315"><span class="label">[315]</span></a> An interesting fact was communicated to me by a friend who
lately descended the Nile; the Nummulitic limestone rocks are in
some parts of the course of the river washed into the stream, and
becoming disintegrated, the Nummulites are set free, and re-deposited
in the recent mud of the Nile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346"> 346 </a></span></p></div>

<p>The Nummulitic limestones are of the Eocene or ancient.
Tertiary epoch, as the labours of Sir Roderick Murchison in
the Alps, Apennines, and Carpathians first established: Nummulites
are unknown in the Secondary formations.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orbitoides.</span>&mdash;The fossil bodies thus named are disciform,
like the Nummulites; and one species, which forms the constituent
substance of ranges of limestone mountains, 300
feet high, near Suggsville, in North America, was first described
by my lamented friend, the late Dr. Morton, of Philadelphia,
as <i>N. Mantelli</i>, in his work on the Cretaceous
Fossils of the United States.</p>

<p>The discovery that the Nummulitic deposits of the Old
World were of the tertiary period, directed attention to their
supposed geological equivalents in America; and on a careful
examination of their fossils, the rocks proved to be tertiary,
and the shells true Foraminifera allied to the Nummulites,
but generically distinct.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> A reference to Dr. Carpenters

<p><span class="smcap">Siderolina</span>, or <i>Siderolites</i>, is a genus of Foraminifera,
which may be described as Nummulites, in which the turns
of the spire are intercepted by elongated appendages, that
project beyond the periphery of the disk, and produce a
stellated figure. These fossils abound in the cretaceous strata
of Maestricht.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fusulina.</span>&mdash;The shell is fusiform, being elongated transversely
to the axis; the cells are divided internally by constrictions.
Only one species is known, (<i>F. cylindrica</i>,) and
this is confined to the Carboniferous formation; it is the
most ancient or earliest type of the class, according to the
present state of our knowledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strata composed of Foraminifera.</span>&mdash;From this concise
exposition of the characters of the genera that most frequently
occur in a fossil state, we pass to the examination of the
organic composition of those limestones which are in a great
measure made up of the debris of Foraminifer&aelig;. We will
commence the investigation with that common substance,
the white chalk of the South-East of England.</p>

<p>It has long been known that a large proportion of the
purest white chalk consists of minute chambered shells,<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and
corals.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_322" id="Footnote_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_322"><span class="label">[322]</span></a> Often termed <i>Polythalamia</i>, meaning many chambers or cells.</p></div>

<p>Mr. Lonsdale, some years since, first showed that by
brushing chalk in water, and examining the sediment, shells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353"> 353 </a></span>
corals, and foraminifera might be obtained in abundance;
but it was not at that time suspected that the residue of the
detritus was almost entirely composed of distinct organic
structures, so minute as to require high magnifying powers,
and a peculiar mode of manipulation, for their detection and
definition.</p>

<p>M. Ehrenberg demonstrated that even the fossils discovered
by Mr. Lonsdale are colossal, in comparison with the
infinitesimal structures of which the finer particles of the
chalk consist; for one cubic inch of the limestone is found
to contain upwards of a million of well-preserved animal
organisms.</p>

<p>The chalk, therefore, is an aggregation of extremely minute
fossils and inorganic particles. The yellow, soft, writing
chalk of the North of Europe, according to M. Ehrenberg, is
composed of about half its mass of organic remains; but in
the chalk of the South of Europe, the fossils predominate.
The amorphous atoms of the cretaceous limestone do not, as
was formerly believed, arise from a precipitate of lime previously
held in solution, but from the disintegration of the
assembled organisms into more minute calcareous particles;
and these have subsequently been reunited by a crystalline
action, into regular, elliptical, granular, bodies.</p>

<p>M. Ehrenberg infers that the compact flint nodules have
originated from an aggregation of pulverulent particles of
siliceous organisms; and upon this hypothesis explains the
absence of flint nodules, and the abundance of siliceous infusoria,
in the beds of marl that alternate with the chalk in
the south of Europe, and their presence in the chalk of
northern Europe, in which the marls are wanting. In other
words, he supposes, that in the former case the siliceous
shells of the animalcules were spread abroad and deposited
in layers or strata; and in the latter were aggregated into
nodular masses. This opinion is not, however, supported by
facts; for, though the animal origin of lime, flint, and iron,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354"> 354 </a></span>
may be admitted to a great extent, yet the deposition of
silex and lime from aqueous solutions, is carried on at the
present moment upon an enormous scale; and it cannot be
doubted that to such a process is attributable the formation
of the nodules, layers, dikes, and veins of flint, which traverse
the chalk, and other rocks.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a></p>

Flint," Annals of Nat. Hist., Aug. 1845.</p></div>

<p>The most abundant microscopic organisms in the English
chalk and flint which I have examined, are <i>Rotali&aelig;</i>, or
<i>Rosalin&aelig;</i>, and <i>Textulari&aelig;</i>. Immense numbers of minuter
Foraminifera also occur, and many shells, which are unquestionably
the young state of testaceous Cephalopoda (as
<i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Ammonite</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

<p>Spines of Sponges, and of Echinoderms, also frequently
appear in the field of the microscope: and a spongeous
structure is so common in flint, that an eminent observer
conceives that all the flints, both nodular and tabular, have
originated from poriferous zoophytes;<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> an hypothesis altogether
inadmissible.</p>

Oolite," by J. S. Bowerbank, Esq. F.R.S. &amp;c. Geol. Trans, vol. vi.
p. 181.</p></div>

<p>The assertion that the chalk every where consists almost
wholly of organic bodies must likewise be accepted with
some limitation. The assiduous observer who searches for
hours chalk and flint carefully prepared, and with the aid of
an excellent microscope, though he will meet with immense
numbers of organisms, will often find a great proportion of
atoms without traces of structure. Neither is there much
variety in the easily recognizable forms of the English chalk
(I write from my own limited experience); many of the
species described by M. Ehrenberg, and others, are few and
far between; and I have not detected a single example of
diatomace&aelig;. The student therefore must not be discouraged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355"> 355 </a></span>
if, after perusing the glowing accounts of the discoveries
of M. Ehrenberg, he should not be more successful
than myself. It must, however, be borne in mind, that as
the fossil remains of the larger animals and plants are commonly
associated together in particular localities, while in
similar rocks in other districts they are altogether wanting;
in like manner, some strata of the same series may be made
up of organic bodies, while others are destitute of them. In
fact, such is the case with our English Chalk: some layers
in the cliffs at Dover are literally an aggregation of foraminifera
and corals, while other beds have but few vestiges of
organic remains.</p>

If some of the powder be immersed in Canada balsam, (as
directed in the instructions at the close of this chapter for
preparing chalk for microscopical examination,) the outline
of the shells, and the cavities of, the cells, will be apparent;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356"> 356 </a></span>

form of the shell and of the

as in <a href="#lign_116"><i>Lign.</i> 116</a>. In this

and one of the cells (<i>a</i>) is
seen to be lined with quartz
crystals.</p>

</div>

<p>At first sight this fossil
might be mistaken for a nautilus
partially filled with spar; but the reader will remark that
the septa, or partitions, have their convex surface towards
the aperture; whereas in the shells of the Cephalopoda
(Nautilus, Ammonite, &amp;c.) the septa are concave anteriorly.
In <a href="#lign_114"><i>Lign.</i> 114, <i>fig.</i> 4</a>, a series of casts in flint of the
septa of a young Nautilus is represented; by comparing it
with the Rotali&aelig; in the same lignograph, <i>figs.</i> 2, 3, this distinction
will be obvious. And here it may be necessary
again to point out the essential character of the animal of
the foraminifera, as distinguished from that of the cephalopoda
with chambered shells. In the latter, the body of the
mollusk only occupies the large outer chamber; the internal
compartments are empty dwellings, which the animal has
successively quitted in the progress of its growth, and with
which it has no connexion except by the siphunculus. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357"> 357 </a></span>
the Rotalia, and allied forms, the body of the animal is
inclosed within the shells, and occupies every chamber contemporaneously
at every stage: the cells are always filled by
the segments of the body. Hence when the shell, which is
calcareous, is dissolved in weak hydrochloric acid, the soft
body is exposed, and seen to extend to the innermost
chamber. The segments are connected by a membranous
tube, which some naturalists regard as a common channel of
communication between the several digestive sacs of which
the body consists; for minute diatomace&aelig; which the animal
has swallowed, (according to Ehrenberg,) are seen within
the membranous sacs; as shown in <a href="#lign_113"><i>Lign.</i> 113</a>, which represents
the body of a Nonionina, deprived of its shell. The
importance of obtaining a correct idea of this structure will
presently appear.</p>

<p>When a recent Rotalia is immersed in dilute acid, the
soft parts of the body, deprived of the shell, may be obtained
entire; they consist of a series of little bags or sacs, united
by a tube. The constituent substance appears to be a tough
membrane, and is generally of a rich brown or amber
colour. The sacs are sometimes full of a granular substance,
but are often empty and collapsed.</p>

microscope with the view of discovering the fossil bodies
described by M. Ehrenberg, I observed that the cells of the
Rotali&aelig; in flint were frequently occupied by a substance
varying in colour from a light amber to a dark brown, and
closely resembling in appearance the body of the recent
foraminifer deprived of its shell. Under a high power, the
folds of the membranous sacs and the connecting tube were
apparent, and I felt convinced that the substance filling the
cells was not inorganic, but the original animal tissues in

the state of molluskite.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> In short, that the animal had

<p>In a paper read before the Geological Society in 1845,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
I ventured to affirm the animal nature of the fossils in
question; but the supposition was regarded by geologists as
very startling and unsatisfactory; and as the specimens
were enveloped in flint, the appearance was attributed to
the infiltration of mineral matter of a different colour from
the surrounding silex, into the empty chambers; a circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359"> 359 </a></span>
of frequent occurrence in Ammonites, Nautili, and
even in the foraminifera; for the latter are often filled with
chalk, flint, silicate of iron, crystal, &amp;c. as in <a href="#lign_116"><i>Lign.</i> 116</a>. In
these instances, I conceive the shells were either empty
when immersed in the fluid chalk or flint, or speedily became
so by the decomposition of the soft parts of the animal.
But in the fossils under consideration, I believe the live
animal was suddenly enveloped, and hermetically sealed, as
it were, in its shell, and that putrefaction was thus prevented.
The uniformity in colour, and the structure of the substance
in the cells, appeared to me incompatible with its assumed
mineral origin, and I resolved to follow up the inquiry by
an examination of Rotali&aelig; in chalk; in the hope that by
dissolving the shell in acid (as in recent foraminifera), the
body of the animal might be detected in an unmineralized
state. After many fruitless attempts, several examples of
the soft bodies of Rotali&aelig; were obtained from the grey chalk
of Dover, in an extraordinary state of preservation.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p>These marvellous relics were obtained by subjecting a few
grains of the chalk to the action of weak hydrochloric acid,
by which the calcareous earth and the shells it contained
were dissolved; the residue, consisting of particles of quartz
and green silicate of iron, and remains of the animal tissues,
were placed, in the usual manner, in Canada balsam. Two
exquisite specimens of the bodies of Rotali&aelig; thus obtained
are figured in <a href="#lign_118"><i>Lign.</i> 118</a>.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p>In these fossils the sacs are generally more or less distended
with a dark substance, as in <a href="#lign_118"><i>Lign.</i> 118, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>: but in some,
they are empty and collapsed in folds, just as membranous

<p>The sacs regularly diminish in size from the innermost to
the outermost cell, and vary in number from fourteen to
twenty-six; being more numerous than in the recent species
of Rotali&aelig; that have come under my notice. In some
instances small papill&aelig; are seen on the outer surface of the

these marvellous fossils.</p></div>

<p>Not only is the form and general character of the animal
substance preserved, but even its flexibility; for in one
instance, the body, released by the solution of the chalk and
shell, was uncoiled and pressed out, as shown in <a href="#lign_119"><i>Lign.</i> 119,

<p>In one specimen, (figured in <i>Philos. Trans.</i> 1846, pl. xxi.

and disposed in numerous duplications, probably

in the chalk; but the discoidal contour of the original is

well preserved. This fossil so closely resembles the decalcified
body of a recent Rotalia or Rosalina, that an eminent
observer who saw it under the microscope at the meeting of
the Royal Society, without knowing its history, concluded it
to be the body of a recent animal. This extraordinary preservation
of the soft delicate tissues of an animal of the
cretaceous seas, invisible to the unassisted eye, through the
incalculable ages that must have elapsed since the deposition
of the chalk in which it was enshrined, is a fact as remarkable

<p>The preservation of the soft parts of foraminifera and of
mollusks, in a fossil state, is a phenomenon of frequent
occurrence, and no longer questioned by geologists, notwithstanding
the scepticism with which my first announcement
of the fact was received. Dr. Bailey, of West Point Military
Academy, soon after the publication of my first paper, sent
me specimens from the marls of New Jersey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foraminiferous Limestones of India.</span>&mdash;So much doubt
was expressed as to the accuracy of my opinion respecting
the nature of the fossil Rotali&aelig;, that its corroboration by
observations on certain limestones in India, by H. J. Carter,
Esq. Secretary of the Bombay Royal Asiatic Society, was as
gratifying as unexpected. According to the researches of
that gentleman, the south-east coast of Arabia is chiefly
composed of two distinct limestone formations; the one
averaging about 4,000 feet above the level of the sea, and
the other 600 feet. The latter forms the desert of Akaf,
and with the intervention of the mountains of Oman, which
belong to the greater formation, passes up into the lower
Sindh; while the former constitutes the high land of the
coast, which, parting from the western border of the Desert
of Akaf, extends nearly to Cape Aden.</p>

<p>The limestones of both these groups, or formations, consist
chiefly of foraminifera; the largest forms being visible to
the naked eye. Mr. Carter states that his attention was
first directed to the organic composition of the Porebunder

<div class="sidenote">FORAMINIFEROUS DEPOSIT AT CHARING.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Foraminiferous Deposit at Charing.</span> <i>Lign. 109.</i>&mdash;The
little town of Charing, in Kent, has acquired a celebrity
among those naturalists who are interested in the present
inquiry, by the researches of William Harris, Esq. F.G.S.
who some years since made known the existence of a remarkable
deposit of chalk detritus, about one foot in thickness,
which extends over the outcrop or exposed surface of the
firestone in that locality.</p>

<p>This bed consists of a soft, whitish, tenacious clay, which,
when immersed in water, is found to be largely composed of
minute grains, that prove to be foraminifera. These shells
belong to many species and genera; and are associated with
the cases of entomostraceous crustaceans, spicula of sponges,
&amp;c. The organisms readily separate from the amorphous
particles by washing, and specimens may be easily obtained
as distinct and perfect as if recent. See <a href="#lign_109"><i>Lign.</i> 109</a>, <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_342">p. 342</a>.
Intermingled with the cretaceous forms, are minute fresh-water
shells, apparently derived from a modern source.</p>

<p>The Charing deposit appears to have originated from the
action of water on the unconsolidated chalk of the neighbouring
Downs, before the surface of the hills was protected
by a covering of vegetable soil.</p>

<p>Through the liberality of Mr. Harris, I have been able to
examine an extensive series of the Charing Foraminifera;
and Prof Williamson has figured and described the principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364"> 364 </a></span>
types in an interesting memoir in the Transactions of the
Manchester Philos. Soc. vol. viii. 1847. As in most of the
cretaceous strata, the prevailing species are referable to the
genera Textularia, Rotalia, Rosalina, Cristellaria, Lagena,<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a>
&amp;c. There are numerous spicula of sponges, and needle-like
calcareous prisms, which are the detritus of the fibrous shells,
called Inoceramus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foraminifera of the Oolite, Lias, &amp;c.</span>&mdash;The occurrence
of certain genera in particular rocks has been incidentally
noticed in the previous descriptions, and it is needless to
particularize any localities of the Oolite, Lias, and other
secondary deposits. It must suffice to state that Dr. Carpenter,
Prof Williamson, Prof Phillips, Mr. Sorby, Mr.
Rupert Jones, and other able observers, have figured and
described foraminifera from the strata between the Chalk
and the Carboniferous formations: the report to be drawn
up by the two first-named gentlemen for the British Association,
will present a resume of the British fossil genera and
species.</p>

<p>It is deserving record, that no vestiges of foraminifera
have been found in the Wealden strata; the fluviatile origin
of those deposits renders it improbable that the remains of
these marine organisms should occur in great numbers, yet
from, the estuary character of some of the beds, the presence
of foraminifera might be expected.</p>

This rock is generally friable and porous; it contains terebratul&aelig;,
spines and cases of echinoderms, pseudo-belemnites,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367"> 367 </a></span>
which contain foraminifera in abundance, are so numerous,
that it is unnecessary to particularize any. The sands of
the Paris basin in some localities are so full of microscopic
forms, that a cubic inch of the mass contains sixty thousand.
The friable calcareous strata at Grignon are a loose aggregate
of the shells of foraminifera and minute mollusks; and as
the fossil shells from that locality are very common, and
generally filled with debris, the student will have no difficulty
in obtaining specimens for examination. The tertiary argillaceous
deposits of England are less rich in foraminifera than
the arenaceous; but the usual types occur in the London
Clay, at Highgate, Clapham Common, Bracklesham Bay, &amp;c.
The Eocene marls of the United States are rich in foraminifera.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FORAMINIFERA OF THE FENS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Foraminifera of the Fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.</span>&mdash;Though
the alluvial deposits of the fen-districts
are comparatively of modern date, yet the rich
assemblage of foraminifera contained in the clay of certain
districts is so interesting and instructive, that a brief notice
of them must not be omitted. The foraminiferous character
of the Lincolnshire alluvium was first made known to me by
specimens from Bolton, sent me by Professor Williamson;
and their extension over a wide area in Cambridgeshire, by
a liberal supply from Mr. Smith, of March. The bed that
abounds in these shells, is about seven feet beneath the
surface, and consists of a fine sea sand combined with carbonaceous
and argillaceous matter. By washing about a
gallon of this earth in water, an ounce of polythalamia and
organic detritus may be obtained. The perfect shells are as
fresh as if just dredged up from the sea; the soft parts&mdash;the
membranous segments held together by their tubular connexion&mdash;in
many instances remaining in the shell; these
parts may be obtained by the solution of the shell in acid.
When the Rotali&aelig; are rendered transparent by immersion
in Canada balsam, their appearance, by transmitted light is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368"> 368 </a></span>
identical with that exhibited by the fossil specimens; and if
viewed by reflected light, the body may be seen occupying
all the cells of the shell; but the segments are somewhat
collapsed; evidently from the shrinking of the animal tissues
after death.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a></p>

<p>The organisms of the Lincolnshire alluvium have been
thoroughly investigated by Prof. Williamson; they comprise
many species and genera, of the usual types; as Rotali&aelig;,
Rosalin&aelig;, Polystomell&aelig;, Textulari&aelig;, Lagen&aelig;, Nodosari&aelig;, &amp;c.
It is remarkable, that though a marine estuary deposit, no
vestiges of diatomace&aelig; have been observed.</p>

<p>The bed so rich in foraminifera, extends west and south-west
of the Wash. Mr. Smith sent me a mass of sandy
clay, from a well sunk in the town of March, to the depth
of twenty-five feet, that was loaded with these beautiful
organisms.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Recent Foraminiferous Deposit at Brighton.</span>&mdash;An interesting
fact connected with the phenomena under review
is deserving record. The presence of the fossils of an older
formation, in strata subsequently deposited, and in part
composed of the detritus of the rocks whence the organic
remains were derived, is not uncommon: such fossils are
termed by the French geologists "<i>fossiles remani&eacute;s</i>." The
nature of these re-deposited fossils is generally obvious;
either by the water-worn condition of shells, bones, &amp;c. or
from their containing particles of their parent bed; or if
casts, from their mineral composition. Thus in the chalk of
St. Catherine's Mount, near Rouen, there are numerous
casts of Ammonites, Scaphites, and other shells, composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369"> 369 </a></span>
of marl full of particles of greensand. These have evidently
been washed out of the preceding cretaceous beds of firestone
or glauconite; and re-deposited in the chalk strata in which
they are now imbedded.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>   *   *   *    *    *</p>

<p>Along the sea-shore, to the east of Brighton, there is a
bank of sand and calcareous mud, the detritus of the neighbouring
cliffs, in the progress of formation; and in this
sediment Mr. Reginald Mantell discovered recent Rotali&aelig;,
Nodosari&aelig;, &amp;c., with frustules of Bacillari&aelig;, Coscinodisci,
Navicul&aelig;, and other diatomace&aelig;; associated with cretaceous
polythalamia washed out of the chalk,<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> The difference
in the aspect of the recent and fossil organisms was so
evident, as to leave no doubt of the correctness of this interpretation.
Here, then, at the present moment, a deposit is
going on, whose organic contents consist of an assemblage of
species of living animalcules of our seas, with the fossil
forms of the ancient chalk ocean; in like manner as in the
bed of the Nile, the Nummulites of the tertiary rocks are
being imbedded with the existing mollusks and desmidi&aelig; of
that river (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_345">p. 345</a>.).</p>

<p>The above statistical view was published six years ago;

<p>I have thus endeavoured to convey a general idea of the
highly important results obtained by the microscopical
investigation of the minute organisms that enter so largely
into the composition of many of the fossiliferous deposits.</p>

<p>Without the aid of the most perfect optical instruments
which modern science and art have produced, even
the existence of many of these structures could not have
been demonstrated; and we cannot doubt, that were the
powers of the microscope increased, the fossil remains of
beings still more minute would be detected; and that rocks
and strata which now appear to consist of amorphous particles
of lime, of silex, and of iron, would prove to be the
aggregated skeletons of animals, yet more infinitesimal than
those which have formed the subject of our contemplations.
How strikingly illustrative are these phenomena of the profound

<p class="caption3">INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF
CHALK, FLINT, AND OTHER ROCKS.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF CHALK.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chalk.</span>&mdash;The following method is that recommended by
M. Ehrenberg, Place a drop of water upon a plate of thin
glass, and put into it as much scraped chalk as will cover
the fine point of a knife, spreading it out, and leaving it to
rest a few seconds; then withdraw the finest particles which
are suspended in the water, together with most of the liquid,
and let the remainder become perfectly dry. Cover this
dried spot of chalk with Canada balsam (the turpentine of
<i>Abies balsamea</i>), and hold the plate of glass over the flame
of a lamp, until the balsam becomes slightly fluid, without
froth or air-bubbles; it should be maintained in this position
(the glass being kept as hot as the finger will bear) for a few
minutes, until the balsam is found to have thoroughly permeated
the substance to be examined. It is preferable to
place a piece of very thin glass upon the balsam, and gently
press it down, and allow it to remain. The best flatted
crown-glass should be used for placing the chalk or other
objects on. It is convenient to have the slips of glass of one
size, or the specimens will require different boxes for their
reception; three inches by one inch is that usually employed.
These objects require to be viewed with a power magnifying
three hundred times linear, that is, in diameter; and
if the process has been properly conducted, it will be seen
that the chalk is chiefly composed of well-preserved organisms.
In these preparations the cells of the foraminifera
appear at first black, with a white central spot; this is caused
by the air contained in those cavities, for air-bubbles always
appear as black annular bodies; by degrees, the balsam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372"> 372 </a></span>
penetrates into all the single cells, the black rings of the air
vesicles disappear, and the structure of the original is beautifully
displayed.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soft part of Rotali&aelig; in chalk.</span>&mdash;The manner in which
I obtained the unmineralized soft bodies of foraminifera from
chalk has already been mentioned (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_360">p. 360</a>.); but it may
be useful to offer a few additional suggestions; for such
fossil remains are not easily extracted. Many experienced
microscopical observers have not succeeded in obtaining one
good specimen; but others have been more fortunate, or
persevering.</p>

<p>In several glass test-tubes, (the more the greater chance
of success,) put a few grains of chalk powder: pour the tube
half full of diluted hydrochloric (muriatic) acid&mdash;about ten
parts water to one of acid&mdash;agitate, and set the mixture by:
when all action has ceased add one or two drops of undiluted
acid to each tube, and repeat the process at due intervals
till all the calcareous matter is dissolved. Pour off the fluid,
substitute distilled water, agitate, and then let the sediment
subside. The residue will consist of atoms of quartz and
other insoluble mineral matter, and animal tissue, if there
be any. Then, with a camel-hair pencil, place a small portion
of the sediment on a glass slide, and when dry cover it
with Canada balsam, and treat it as above directed. Among
a dozen slides thus mounted, there will probably be two or
more good examples of the body, or detached membranous
segments of Rotali&aelig; or Textulari&aelig;, like those figured in
<a href="#lign_118"><i>Lign.</i> 118</a>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Calcareous Sandstones and Marls.</span>&mdash;These substances
may be examined by the same process; but if of loose
texture, Dr. Bailey recommends that some of the sandy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373"> 373 </a></span>
powder should be spread very thinly on a plate of glass,
with or without water, and by the aid of a lens of moderate
power the roundish grains should be selected and picked up
with fine forceps, or the point of a needle, and transferred to
another piece of glass, having on one spot a thin coat of
Canada balsam. This should be gently heated over a spirit
lamp, when the balsam will penetrate the grains, and render
them transparent; by this process the minutest shells, &amp;c.
may be detected. For a hasty exploration, the dust may be
rendered sufficiently transparent by a drop or two of oil of
turpentine.</p>

<p>Sandy calcareous marls may be examined by diffusing a
few grains in water in a wine-glass, the lighter portions will
be suspended in the fluid, and may be placed on glass, and
when dry prepared with Canada balsam in the usual manner.</p>


<div class="sidenote">MICROSCOPICAL EXAMINATION OF FLINT.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Flint.</span>&mdash;Flint, and other siliceous stones, require to be
chipped into very thin fragments, and immersed in oil of
turpentine. A clear, translucent flint should be selected,
from which fragments may be shattered off by smart blows
of a hammer, over a sheet of white paper: the most transparent
flakes are to be selected, and these should be put in
oil of turpentine, in a wide-mouth glass bottle. Take out
the pieces for examination with forceps, and inspect them as
transparent objects, by transmitted light. When good specimens
are discovered, mount them in Canada balsam.</p>

<p>It is hazardous to entrust such fossils to the lapidaries;
an interesting group of twenty spiniferites was reduced to
ten, by one of our best workmen, in whose hands it was
placed for polishing, with the view of rendering it more
transparent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On Fossil Mollusca.</span>&mdash;Numerous as are the fossil remains
of the various types of animal organization which have
already passed under review, they are far exceeded in number
and variety by those of the beings whose mineralized relics
we now propose to investigate. Although every one is
familiar with the external appearance of the shells cast up
by the waves on the shores of our island, and of those which,
from their varied colours and elegant forms, are preserved in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"> 375 </a></span>
the cottage of the peasant, and in the mansion of the rich,
but few persons are conversant with the nature of the animals
that secreted and were protected by these beautiful and
enduring structures. The organization even of the oyster,
mussel, whelk, &amp;c., is known only to the naturalist. Appearing
to the uninstructed eye as a shapeless gelatinous mass, there
is nothing to arrest the attention, or excite the curiosity.
Yet the beings which inhabited these durable cases, are
objects of the highest interest and present a rich field of
instructive investigation.</p>

<p>Except as shedding some light on the structure and
economy of their inhabitants, the shells, in the estimation of
the naturalist, are the least interesting part of the organization
of the Mollusca; but to the geologist, from their
permanent nature, and the proofs they yield of the conditions
under which the strata that contain them were deposited,
they are important in the highest degree. It has even been
found convenient to classify formations, in which fossil shells
largely prevail, by the relative numerical proportion of the
recent and extinct species found in the different groups of
strata; and the terms, Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene, (proposed
by Sir C. Lyell,) have reference to this character, as
we have previously explained (<i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_24">p. 24</a>.).</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL MOLLUSCA.</div>

<p>The <i>Mollusca</i>, a name indicative of the soft nature of the
integuments of these animals, constitute a very comprehensive
subdivision of the animal kingdom, and are separable
into two principal groups, viz. the <i>Acephala</i> and the <i>Encephala</i>.</p>

<p>I. The <span class="smcap">Acephala</span> (so termed because they are destitute
of a head) have neither jaws, tongue, nor a distinct mouth.
They are aquatic, and are subdivided into classes, according
to the modification of their integument, or of their gills.</p>

<p><i>a.</i> The <span class="smcap">Tunicata</span> (from the elastic <i>tunic</i>, or <i>mantle</i>, in
which they are enclosed) have no shell, and therefore do not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376"> 376 </a></span>
come within the scope of our inquiries: yet it is possible
that the soft parts even of these perishable structures may
have left some trace, or that markings of their integument
on the silt or mud may be preserved;<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> and I would recommend
the student to search for such indications on the
rippled surface of clays and sandstones.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_348" id="Footnote_348"></a><a href="#FNanchor_348"><span class="label">[348]</span></a> The <i>Ischadites K&ouml;nigi</i> of the Ludlow rock was supposed to
resemble <i>Boltenia</i>, a pedunculated Ascidian.</p></div>

<p><i>b.</i> The <span class="smcap">Brachiopoda</span> (<i>arm-feet</i>) have two long spiral
fleshy arms, or brachia, developed from the sides of the
alimentary orifice, are enclosed in bivalve shells, and respire
by means of their vascular skin, or mantle. They have not
the power of locomotion, but are fixed by a peduncle to
other bodies.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> The <span class="smcap">Lamellibranchia</span> (<i>plated gills</i>) have also bivalve
shells, but their respiration is effected by gills composed of
vascular membrane disposed in plates, and attached to the
mantle; the <i>beard</i> of the Oyster is the branchial or respiratory
apparatus of that animal. These bivalve Mollusca
are subdivided into those which close their shells by one
adductor muscle, hence called <i>monomyaria</i>, as the Oyster;
and those which have two muscles, <i>dimyaria</i>, as the Cockle.
As the impressions left on the shells, by the attachment of
these adductor muscles, and by the margin of the mantle,
are found as perfect in the fossil as in the recent, they constitute
important distinctive characters.</p>

<p>Dr. Gray's definition of the respective parts of univalve
and bivalve shells is at once clear, concise, and natural,
being conformable to the structure of the body of the
enclosed mollusk.</p>

<p>The <i>front</i> of the shell is the part which covers the head of
the animal; the back of the shell is the part which covers
the tail; the left and right sides correspond with the same
parts of the mollusk.</p>

<p>In univalves, the apex of the shelly cone whether it be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377"> 377 </a></span>
simply conical or spiral (except in Patella) is over the hinder
part of the animal: when the shell is placed on its mouth
with the apex towards the observer, the parts of the shell
correspond with the position of the person looking at it.</p>

<p>(The length of the shell is estimated from <i>o</i> to <i>p</i>, its breadth from <i>l</i> to <i>n</i>.)</p>

<p>In bivalves (<a href="#lign_121"><i>Lign.</i> 121</a>) the ligament is always on the
dorsal surface of the animal, and the mouth in front of the
apex or umbo of the valves, before the ligament. A bivalve
placed with the hinge side uppermost and the ligament
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378"> 378 </a></span>
towards the observer is in the same relative position as the
person looking at it; viz. the <span class="smcap">head</span> in front, and the right
and left valves in their natural relations. The length of the
shell is therefore from the front to the back of the animal:
the width or transverse diameter is from the umbo to the
margin. Much confusion has arisen from many conchologists
having described the length and width of a shell
diametrically opposite to the proper position of its inhabitant.</p>


<p>II. <span class="smcap">The Encephalous Mollusca.</span>&mdash;These possess a head,
with feelers or soft tentacula, eyes, and a mouth with jaws;
they are arranged in classes, according to the modification
of their locomotive organs; for, with but few exceptions,
they are free animals, and can crawl, climb, or swim. Their
shells are, for the most part, composed of one piece, or valve,
hence they are termed <i>Univalves</i>. In some genera the shell
is a simple cavity, spirally disposed, as in the Snail; in
others, it is conical, consisting of one or many pieces, as in
the <i>Limpet</i> and <i>Chiton</i>. In the Cephalopoda it is internally
divided into cells, or chambers, as, for example, in the
Nautilus.</p>

<p>The Encephalous Mollusca are subdivided into the following
classes; viz.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>a.</i> <span class="smcap">Pteropoda</span> (<i>wing-feet</i>).&mdash;In these the organs of progression
are two wing-like muscular expansions, proceeding
from the sides of the neck, by which they can swim and
float in the open sea: all the species are of small size.</p>

<p><i>b.</i> <span class="smcap">Gasteropoda</span> (<i>feet under the body</i>).&mdash;These crawl by
means of a muscular disk, or foot, which is attached to the
under-part of the body; most of the species are marine, but
some are terrestrial, and others inhabit fresh-water. They
are very widely distributed; the garden snail is a familiar
instance of a terrestrial Gasteropod.</p>

<p><i>c.</i> <span class="smcap">Cephalopoda</span> (<i>feet around the head</i>).&mdash;The mollusca of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"> 379 </a></span>
this order have powerful muscular arms, or tentacula, which
surround the head, or upper part of the body; some genera
have no shell, but possess an internal skeleton, as the recent
Sepiad&aelig; and the fossil Belemnitid&aelig;. Most of the testaceous
Cephalopoda have a discoidal, univalve shell, which is divided
internally by septa or partitions; as the Nautilus.</p>


<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL MOLLUSCA.</div>

<p>In many univalves the aperture or opening is entire, that
is, without any notch or groove; in others it is notched or
extended into a canal, or siphon, and this character has relation
to the respiratory organs: thus the Gasteropods, in
which the water is conducted to the interior by a muscular
tube, or siphon, have the margin of the aperture of the shell
channelled; as in the Whelk, or <i>Buccinum</i>. Many of the
land and fresh-water species have entire openings, and are,
for the most part, herbivorous; while the greater number
of the marine univalves have the aperture indented or
notched, and are carnivorous.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Some of these mollusca, too,
have a retractile proboscis, armed with minute teeth, by
which they can rasp or bore into the shells of the species on
which they prey. There are some exceptions to the above
rules, but the prevalence of the characters specified afford
pretty certain indications of the fluviatile or marine nature
of the originals. The application of these data to geological
investigations will be considered hereafter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_349" id="Footnote_349"></a><a href="#FNanchor_349"><span class="label">[349]</span></a> The form of the aperture does not necessarily indicate fresh-water
genera. <i>Melanopsis</i>, <i>Pirena</i>, and most of the <i>Melani&aelig;</i> have a
channelled or notched aperture. Fresh-water univalves frequently
have the spire corroded; in a fossil state they can only be determined
[to be fresh-water species] by their analogy to recent genera and sub-genera.&mdash;<i>Note
by Mr. Woodward.</i></p></div>

<p>In the generic distinctions of the simple univalves, the
form of the mouth is an important character; while in the
bivalves, the configuration of the hinge affords an equally
convenient aid for their classification.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380"> 380 </a></span></p>

<p>Some tribes of testaceous mollusca are exclusively marine;
many are restricted to the brackish water of estuaries; others
live only in fresh-water; and some on the land. Their
geographical distribution is alike various: certain groups
inhabit deep water only, and are provided with means by
which they can maintain themselves near the surface of the
ocean, far away from any shore; while others are littoral,
that is, live in the shallows along the sea-shores. Many
exist in quiet, others in turbulent waters; some are gregarious,
like the oyster; while others occur singly, or in groups.
The vertical range, that is, the relative depths in which the
mollusca live in the sea, is also strictly defined; certain
genera being, in a great measure, restricted to moderate
depths, others to a few fathoms, and many to the profound
abysses of the ocean, which neither the dredge nor the
plummet can reach. All these varieties of condition are
more or less strongly impressed on the shells, which may be
considered as external skeletons;<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> and the accomplished
conchologist is enabled, by certain characters, to determine
the nature of the animals which inhabited them, and the
physical conditions in which they were placed.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_350" id="Footnote_350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_350"><span class="label">[350]</span></a> In equivalve bivalves the animal lives in an upright position. In
inequivalves, <i>i.e.</i> one large and one small valve, the animal lies on its
side. The situation of bivalve shells, as oysters, should therefore be
noticed, for if they lie on their concave shell, with the flat valve
uppermost, it is evident they were overwhelmed in their native bed
and in a living state; if they lie indiscriminately on either valve, they
were probably dead shells and overwhelmed in that state. If the
pallial imprint is notched by a sinus, it shows the presence and size
of the tubes of the mantle. Whether there be one or two muscular
impressions is of far less importance.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_351" id="Footnote_351"></a><a href="#FNanchor_351"><span class="label">[351]</span></a> For an extended notice of the geographical distribution of
testacea, see Prof. Edward Forbes, British Marine Zoology, Part I.
p. 141.</p></div>

<p>The number of living species of mollusca known to naturalists,
not including the shell-less genera, exceeds twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"> 381 </a></span>
thousand; and almost every day is adding new species, for
scarcely a vessel arrives from distant seas without enriching
the stores of the conchologist. The numerous genera into
which they are divided by systematists, and the constant
changes effected in arrangement and nomenclature by every
writer on the subject, render it difficult if not impossible to
present the reader with any satisfactory epitome of modern
conchology.</p>

<p>I must restrict myself to a brief account of some of the
most common genera that occur in the British strata; and
shall dwell more particularly on those species which prevail
in the secondary formations, because they present the most
important deviations from the recent types that are familiar
to the general observer; by this means, and by reference
to figures in standard works, the collector will, I trust,
be enabled to identify the fossil shells which may most
frequently come under his notice in the course of his geological
rambles.</p>



<p class="caption3">FOSSIL BIVALVE SHELLS; INCLUDING THE BRACHIOPODA AND
LAMELLIBRANCHIA.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL BIVALVE SHELLS.</div>

<p>Although in the modern Tertiary strata, as the Crag, and
in the arenaceous beds of the Eocene formations, shells are
generally found in so perfect a state, that no caution or
knowledge is requisite for their collection, yet a few preliminary
remarks are necessary to point out certain conditions
in which the remains of mollusca, or evidence of their existence,
occur in the mineral kingdom, and particularly in the
older fossiliferous rocks. Shells are found in the strata in
the three following states:&mdash;</p>

<p>1stly. Shells in which the constituent substance has undergone
but little change. Many of the specimens in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382"> 382 </a></span>
sands of the Crag in Norfolk and Suffolk, and in the Eocene
beds at Grignon, near Paris, and the Pliocene of Palermo, in
Sicily, are as perfect as if collected from the sea-shore, having
suffered no loss but that of colour. In some instances, even
the varied markings on the surface remain; but in general
the shells are bleached, or have a ferruginous stain.</p>

<p>2dly. The form preserved, but the constituent substance
mineralized. This state is very common in shells that are
imbedded in hard rock, whatever may be the age of the
deposit. In calcareous strata the testaceous substance is
generally transmuted into calcareous spar, as in most of the
specimens from the chalk, oolite, mountain limestone, &amp;c.
In sands abounding in silex, the shell is changed into flint,
as in the exquisite fossils from the Greensand of Blackdown,
Devonshire; in deposits permeated with sulphuret of iron,
the shells are often metamorphosed into pyrites, as in the
Ammonites in the Lias, Galt, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3dly, In the state of casts and impressions. Although in
loose sand the shells are either empty, or filled with detritus
easily removable by washing; in clay, limestone, and sandstone,
the cavities are generally occupied by consolidated
materials, which had entered when in a soft or fluid state;
and frequently the substance of the shell has disappeared,
and the stony cast of the interior alone remains. In many
instances, the spaces left by the dissolution of the shells are
filled with spar, or the casts are closely invested by the
surrounding stone, from long-continued superincumbent
pressure while the matrix was in a plastic state; and in such
cases the casts are often distorted and flattened. But the
vacancy is occasionally empty, and on its walls is found an
impress of the external surface of the shell, with all the lines
and ornaments of the original as sharp as if cast in plaster
of Paris.</p>

<p>The specimen, <a href="#lign_122"><i>Lign.</i> 122, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>, from the tertiary strata
at Bracklesham Bay, Sussex, is a polished slice of indurated
argillaceous limestone, from a septarium (<i>nodule divided by
fissures</i>), abounding in spiral univalve shells, called <i>Turritell&aelig;</i>.
<i>Fig.</i> 1 is a perfect shell of the same species, extracted
from soft clay; and <i>fig.</i> 3, a cast in calcareous spar, obtained
from the septarium. In the polished slab, <i>fig.</i> 2,
sections of numerous shells are seen. The dark partitions,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384"> 384 </a></span>
or septa, are veins of spar, which occupy interstices that have
been formed in the clay-nodule by shrinking; and if the
specimen be closely examined, the shells will be found split
across and displaced by the fissures; thus presenting an
interesting illustration of the faults, or dislocations, of the
strata, so familiar to the geological observer. In the present
instance, the lines on the exterior of the shell do not materially
differ from those on the interior, and, consequently,
the cast, <i>fig.</i> 3, and the shell. <i>fig.</i> 1, resemble each other;
but in many species there is a striking contrast between the
outer and inner surfaces, the external aspect being strongly
ornamented, while the internal is smooth; the cast, therefore,
in such examples, so little resembles the shell, that an
inexperienced collector may readily suppose it belongs to a
different species. The bivalve called Trigonia, <a href="#lign_127"><i>Lign.</i> 127,
<i>figs.</i> 1, 2</a>, is an instance of this contrast.</p>

<p>The polished slab of the Septarium, <a href="#lign_122"><i>Lign.</i> 122, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>,
demonstrates another condition of fossil shells&mdash;that of a
compact argillaceous limestone&mdash;and entire beds of marble
are composed of an aggregation of this kind, formed of shells
and other animal exuvi&aelig;, consolidated by mineral infiltrations.
In the older secondary strata this state prevails; and
the beautiful markings of many valuable marbles, are merely
sections of the enclosed shells. But this process is not
restricted to the deposits of ancient date; at the present
moment the same operation is silently but constantly going
on in our seas, and an examination of the specimen, <i>Lign.</i>
123, will afford an exemplification of the manner in which
these shelly limestones are produced.</p>

have been formed in a similar manner; and when the

<p>Off the Kentish coast, near the mouth of the Thames, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387"> 387 </a></span>
bank of consolidated shells, chiefly of one species, is in the
progress of formation, from which blocks may be obtained
of great firmness and solidity (<a href="#lign_124"><i>Lign.</i> 124</a>); these, when cut
and polished (<i>fig.</i> 3), display a variety of markings, produced
by the sections of the shells. Extensive shoals of loose
shells, composed almost wholly of the <i>Cardium edule</i>, exist
in several localities, near the embouchure of the Thames;
and these are continually shifting with the changes of the
wind and tide; it is only in a few places that consolidated
blocks occur, like that of which a fragment is figured in
<a href="#lign_124"><i>Lign.</i> 124</a>. These examples of shelly limestones and sandstones
now in progress of formation will familiarize the
student with the nature and origin of those ancient deposits
of a similar character, which contain extinct species and
genera of mollusca.</p>

<p>"The vast deposits of fluviatile shells which exist in
Florida, at Picolata, Volusia, and Enterprize are of great
geological interest. The two latter places present bluffs and
hills of from forty to fifty feet in height, extending half
a mile or more from the river, that are composed of scarcely
anything but well-preserved shells of <i>Paludina vivipara</i>,
<i>Ampullaria depressa</i>, some undetermined species of <i>Unio</i>,
<i>Helix septemvolvis</i>, <i>Melania</i>, and a few others. There is but
a scanty mixture of earth, and the shells are clean, and
look as if they had been washed ashore after the death of
their inhabitants. In some places the beds are sandy, and
are hardening into a calcareous shelly sandstone. In one
such bed the superficial stratum furnished a few bones of
turtles and undetermined fragments, the bones of some large
vertebrate animal. This is, I believe, the locality where
Count Pourtal&eacute;s collected human bones in a recent sandstone....
No microscopical forms were detected in
these beds after the most careful search."<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a></p>

even vestiges of the colour occasionally remain. In a living
state, the animal is fixed to foreign bodies by a byssus, or
peduncle, which passes through the opening in the beak,
or arched extremity, of the shells,<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> The most interesting
circumstance relating to these mollusca, is the respiratory
apparatus, which consists of two long ciliated tubes,
spirally coiled, united at their base, and supported by slender
calcareous processes, which are often preserved in the fossils.
Thus, in specimens from the soft chalk, the calcareous earth
may be removed from the interior of the shell, and the
appendages exposed, as in the examples, <a href="#lign_126"><i>Lign.</i> 126, <i>figs.</i> 1, 2</a>;

<p>All these genera are extinct; they prevail in the oldest
fossiliferous rocks, and gradually disappear as we ascend to
the newer formations; the last trace of their existence is in
the Lias, in which one species has been found. But the
<i>Terebratul&aelig;</i> abound in the Lias, Oolite, Chalk, &amp;c., occur
in the tertiary formations, and several living species inhabit
the seas around Australia and New Zealand. (See <i>ante</i> <a href="#Page_390">p. 390</a>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhynchonella</span>, <i>Fischer</i>. The "<i>plaited</i>" <i>Terebratul&aelig;</i> differ
from the typical species (<i>e.g.</i> <i>T. australis</i>, caput-serpentis,
vitrea, &amp;c.) more than even the Spirifers differ, and must be
regarded as forming a distinct <i>family</i>, <span class="smcap">Rhynchonellid&aelig;</span>,
which will include <i>Pentamerus</i>. The shell is not punctate;
the arms are spiral, supported only at their origins by
shelly processes; the larger valve is <i>beaked</i> acutely, and has
a notch within the beak through which the pedicle passes;
sometimes the notch is converted into a foramen, by two
little plates, (<i>deltidium</i>,) as in <i>Terebratula</i>. The form of
the Rhynchonell&aelig; is tetrahedral. <a href="#lign_125"><i>Lign.</i> 125.</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pentamerus</span>, <i>Ly.</i> p. 352.&mdash;With the Spirifers, and other
Brachiopoda of the Silurian System, some bivalves which,
in their general figure, resemble certain species of Terebratul&aelig;,
frequently occur. These shells differ in their internal
structure from all other genera, in having a septum, or
plate, by which their cavity is divided into four chambers;
and in one valve the septum itself contains a cell, thus
making five chambers, whence the name <i>Pentamerus</i> (<i>five-celled</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392"> 392 </a></span>
The casts of these shells often have fissures, produced
by the decomposition of the septa; and occasionally
these cavities are occupied by calcareous spar. Specimens
of this kind commonly split into two parts, in one of which
two, and in the other three, chambers may be detected; the
fifth chamber is the canal of the peduncle. Four species
are known, and all belong to the Silurian rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orthis</span>, <span class="smcap">Lept&aelig;na</span>, and <span class="smcap">Producta</span> form a third family,
with horizontal spiral arms, unsupported by shelly processes.
<i>Davidsonia</i> is a Lept&aelig;na <i>attached</i> by the ventral valve, and
the only genus in this family which is fixed by <i>the shell
itself</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calceola.</span> a genus of Brachiopoda; the shell of an
inverted pyramidal form, the upper valve nearly flat; found
in the Devonian strata of the Eifel, and in Devonshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Crania</span>, <i>Ly.</i> <i>fig.</i> 205. These are small brachiopodous
shells, attached to other bodies; very frequently to the
Echinites of the chalk. The free valve is commonly
wanting, but I have found specimens dispersed in the rock.
In many of the quarries in Kent and Sussex, the helmet
Echinites bear groups of these shells. <i>Ly. fig.</i> 13.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Orbicula.</span> This genus resembles Crania in form, the
upper valve being like a limpet, whilst the attached valve is
flat; it differs, however, from Crania in being horny and
flexible, and is fixed to rocks on the bed of the sea, by a
muscular pedicle passing out through a small fissure.</p>

<p>Species of Orbicula are found in strata of all ages, from
the Lower Silurian to the Tertiary, and several are now
living in tropical seas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Obolus.</span> <i>Eichwald.</i> In the Lower Silurian (<i>Obolite grit</i>)

<div class="sidenote">LINGULA. HIPPURITES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lingula.</span> <i>Ly.</i> p. 353, <i>fig.</i> 412.&mdash;The Brachiopoda referred
to this genus have a long peduncle, and their respiratory
apparatus has no calcareous support; the recent
species burrow in the sand, being usually inhabitants of
shallow waters. The <i>Lingul&aelig;</i> a&aelig;re readily distinguished
from the Terebratul&aelig; by their imperforate, equivalved shells.
One species is found in the Aymestry limestone, and several
have been collected from the Mountain limestone, Oolite,
and Shanklin sand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With reference to the species of Brachiopoda, particularly
of the Terebratul&aelig;, which inhabit the depths of the ocean,
Professor Owen observes, that "both the respiration and
nutrition of animals, which exist beneath a pressure of from
sixty to ninety fathoms of sea-water, are subjects suggestive
of interesting reflections, and lead us to contemplate with
less surprise the great strength and complexity of some of
the minutest parts of the frame of these diminutive creatures.
In the unbroken stillness which pervades those
abysses, the existence of these animals must depend on
their power of exciting a perpetual current around them, in
order to dissipate the water laden with their effete particles,
and to bring within the reach of their prehensile organs the
animalcules adapted for their sustenance."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Hippurites.</span> This genus belongs to a group of fossil
shells whose characters are somewhat problematical, some
conchologists referring them to the ordinary bivalves, and
others to the Brachiopoda. Although <i>Hippurites</i> have not
been discovered in the British strata, I am induced to
notice them in this place, in consequence of their great
abundance in the Cretaceous deposits of the South of
France, and in the Oolite of the Pyrenees; and also to
illustrate the nature of a nearly related genus, <i>Sph&aelig;rulites</i>,
of which one or more species occur in the Sussex Chalk.</p>

<p>The Hippurite is of an elongated conical form, and fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394"> 394 </a></span>
by its base; it has internally a deep lateral channel, formed
by two obtuse longitudinal ridges. The base is sometimes
partitioned off by transverse septa, forming cells or cavities,
as in the Euomphalus. The aperture, or opening, is closed
by an operculum, or upper valve. The substance of the
shell is cellular, and very thick, and when fractured much
resembles that of the lamelliferous corals: the lamin&aelig; are
sometimes separated into cells, or cavities, like the Spondyli.
These shells often attain considerable magnitude, and in
certain districts of the Pyrenees, where they abound, are
called "<i>petrified horns</i>" by the inhabitants. It is remarkable,
that, while in the Chalk of the South of France,
Spain, Portugal, and Greece shells of this genus so prevail,
as to be considered the characteristic fossils of the formation,
in the North of France they are very rare, and in England
have not hitherto been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

is one of these supposed petrified horns, described by the

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Shells of the Lamellibranchia.</span>&mdash;These are
bivalve shells, the animals of which differ from the preceding
class, as we have already stated, in performing respiration
by means of lamellated gills. The valves are united
by a strong substance, termed the ligament, which, by its
elasticity, admits of the shells being opened to a considerable
extent; and they are closed by powerful, short, thick
muscles, called adductors. The shells of some of the genera,
as the Oyster and Scallop, have but one muscle, (<i>monomyaria</i>);
others, as the Cockle, or Cardium, and Venus, have
two, (<i>dimyaria</i>); and by these characters the class is arranged
in two groups.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL OYSTERS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ostrea</span>, <a href="#lign_120"><i>Lign.</i> 120.</a>&mdash;The Oyster is well known to possess
no power of locomotion; it is attached to rocks, pebbles,
and other bodies, and forms extensive beds, consisting of
numerous individuals, of all sizes. There are many fossil
species; the British strata yield between forty and fifty. In
some localities. Oysters are found in thick beds, of great
extent, apparently on the spots they occupied when living.
One of the most interesting localities I am acquainted with,
is Sundridge Park, near Bromley, in Kent, where a hard
conglomerate, entirely made up of oyster-shells, and the
shingle that formed their native bed, is quarried. This
stone is much employed for ornamental rock-work, and
several walls in and near Bromley are constructed of it:
these display the fossils, some with the valves closed, others
open, others detached, and the whole grouped as if artificially
imbedded to expose the characters of the shells.
These oyster-beds belong to the tertiary strata of the London
basin; they extend to Plumstead, and other places in the
vicinity; and in some localities, the oysters are associated
with other bivalves, called <i>Pectunculi</i>. In the tertiary clays
near Woolwich and Bexley, fossil oyster-shells abound. In
the neighbourhood of Reading, in Berkshire, an extensive
layer of fossil oysters occupies the same geological position,
namely, the lowermost sands and clays of the London basin.
Wherever the strata around London are perforated to a sufficient
depth, this oyster-bed is reached. Very recently an
Artesian well was bored at Hanwell, in Middlesex, and at
the depth of two hundred and eighty feet this stratum of
sand with oyster-shells was found. At Headley, near
Reigate, in Surrey, there is a similar deposit. These oysters
very closely resemble the edible species.</p>

<p>The White Chalk contains several species of Ostrea, but I
believe no beds of these shells have been found in it; on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396"> 396 </a></span>
contrary, the shells are diffused promiscuously through the
strata. I have collected a few groups of from thirty to
forty shells, evidently the young or fry of the species
(<i>O. semiplana</i>) figured <a href="#lign_120"><i>Lign.</i> 120</a>. This specimen is an
interesting example of the petrifactive process which the
mollusca have occasionally undergone; the soft parts of the
oyster are transmuted into flint, and the shell is changed
into carbonate of lime, having a crystalline structure. Both
valves were perfect when discovered, but I chiselled off the
greater part of one shell to expose the silicified body of the
animal.</p>

<p>A small oyster, called <i>Ostrea vesicularis</i>, is a characteristic
shell of the chalk; one valve is convex, the other flat; it is
abundant in the Chalk of Norfolk, and also in the Firestone
of some localities: it is figured <i>Ly.</i> p. 212. Another
small species, having the margin plicated (<i>O. plicata</i>),
is also frequent in the Chalk. A large shell, with the
margins deeply indented by angular folds, resembling the
recent cockscomb oyster, is abundant in the Chalk Marl and
Firestone; particularly near Dover, and around Selbourne
in Hampshire, where it attracted the notice of <span class="smcap">White</span>, by
its resemblance to the living "Cockscomb Oyster" of the
West Indies; it is named <i>Ostrea carinata</i>, and figured <i>Ly.</i>
p. 212, <i>fig.</i> 204. One other species may be noticed, the
Ostrea deltoidea, which has been found in every locality of
the Kimmeridge Clay in England and France. It is a very
flat species, and of a triangular form; the specific name is
derived from a supposed resemblance to the Greek letter &#916;,
<i>delta</i>. I believe that in England no shells of this genus
have been observed in strata older than the Lias.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gryphya.</span> <a href="#lign_127"><i>Lign.</i> 127, <i>fig.</i> 6.</a>&mdash;The shells to which the
term <i>Gryph&aelig;a</i>, or <i>Gryphites</i>, is applied, are related to the
Oyster, but distinguished by the deep concave under valve,
and its curved summit, or beak, and the almost flat, or
opercular upper shell. The Gryphites are of a finer laminated
structure than the oysters, and the ligament of the
hinge is inserted in an elongated curved groove. There are
about thirty British fossil species, none of which have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398"> 398 </a></span>
noticed below the Lias, in which formation one very remarkable
species is so abundant as to be considered characteristic
of the Liassic deposits. It is so faithfully represented,
<a href="#lign_127"><i>Lign.</i> 127, <i>fig.</i> 6</a>, that description is unnecessary. In the
upper argillaceous beds of the Oolite and Kimmeridge
Clay, a very small gryphite, (<i>G. virgula</i>, <i>Ly.</i> p. 260) is
so abundant, that it constitutes entire layers. The low
cliffs on the west of Boulogne harbour, like those near
Weymouth, are composed of this clay, and myriads of the
gryphites are scattered on the shore, with other shells of
the same deposits; these shelly beds are called <i>marnes &agrave;
gryph&eacute;es</i>, by the French geologists. A very large gryphite,
<i>Gryph&aelig;a sinuata</i>, (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 336,) is found in the
Shanklin sand of the Isle of Wight, and of Kent and
Sussex. At low water, in the sand along the shore under
Dunnose Cliff, near Shanklin Chine, numerous specimens
are always obtainable.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SPONDYLUS. PLAGIOSTOMA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Spondylus.</span> <i>Lign. 128.</i>&mdash;A species of this genus is so
frequent in the Chalk, that it ranks with certain Terebratul&aelig;,
as characteristic of that formation. One valve is
covered with long slender spines, which, in the usual
examples, are destroyed by the mode of extracting them.
The specimen figured shows the appearance of a shell partly
cleared; the remainder of the chalk might be removed by
a penknife (taking care to leave the longest spines supported
by brackets of chalk), and it would then resemble
the beautiful fossils figured <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 78, and in
<i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 125. Between the beaks there is a triangular
aperture in the spinous valve, which some naturalists, with
much probability, suppose was once filled up with shell, as
in the recent species.</p>

<p>In the cretaceous strata of North America, Dr. Morton
has discovered a Spondylus (<i>S. dumosus</i>) very nearly
related to <i>S. spinosus</i>; but it differs in its general form, and
has both valves beset with strong spines. I have the fragment
of a large bivalve from the Kentish Rag (Mr. Bensted's
quarry), which has the peculiar structure of the Water-clam
(<i>Spondylus varius</i> of Mr. Broderip); namely, hollow
interspaces formed by shelly layers or partitions, which
were secreted by the posterior part of the mantle, or investing
integument of the animal, as it gradually receded
from that part of the shell. In the recent Water-clam the
cells are full of fluid.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Plagiostoma</span>, Llhwyd, 1699. This genus, adopted by
Mr. Sowerby in the Mineral Conchology, is scarcely distinguishable
from <i>Lima</i> of Bruguiere (1791). Most of the
recent species are ornamented with small asperities, from
which the name <i>lima</i> (file) is derived; they are symmetrical
shells attached by a byssus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400"> 400 </a></span></p>

<p>Several smooth species of this genus are found in the
Chalk,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> Oolite, and Lias. A very large species (<i>P. giganteum</i>),
sometimes ten inches in diameter, abounds in the Lias
(<i>Ly.</i> p. 274). It is somewhat depressed in form, with the
surface slightly striated; each valve has a pointed beak,
with two lateral expansions, or ears, as they are termed by
conchologists.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_360" id="Footnote_360"></a><a href="#FNanchor_360"><span class="label">[360]</span></a> See Foss. South Downs,, plate xxvi.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Plicatula</span>, is another genus of this family, of which
there are three British fossil species. A delicate shell, with
slender depressed spines (<i>P. inflata</i>. <i>Foss. South D.</i> pl.
xxvi.), occurs in the Chalk Marl. The recent species are
natives of the seas of warm climates.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pecten.</span>&mdash;The common scallop-shell will serve as a type
of this genus. The animals of these shells, unlike the
oysters, have the power of locomotion, and when in the
water, may be seen moving with rapidity, and flapping their
shells to and fro with great activity. Numerous species are
found fossil. In the Pliocene, and other marine tertiary
deposits, Pectens abound; in the White Chalk there are
several elegant forms (see <i>Foss. South D.</i> plate xxv.); many
kinds in the Oolite and Lias; and several in the Devonian
strata.</p>

<p>A large Mediterranean species (<i>Pecten Jacob&aelig;us</i>, <i>Ly.</i>
p. 152) occurs in the Pliocene strata of Palermo, in every
stage of growth, and as perfect as if recent. The Chalk
and Shanklin sand contain a small inequivalved Pecten, the
lower valve of which is convex, and pentangular, the upper
flat, and both strongly ribbed, or pectinated; it is named
<i>Pecten quinquecostatus</i> (<i>Foss. South D.</i> pl. xxvi. <i>Ly.</i> p. 212);
and in the cretaceous strata of North America a variety of
this species is found.</p>

<p>In the Chalk Marl a large and beautiful Pecten (<i>P. Beaveri.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401"> 401 </a></span>
<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 158) is very common, and I have
obtained from Hamsey and Southerham examples in the
most perfect state of preservation; it is a characteristic

<p><span class="smcap">Inoceramus.</span> <a href="#lign_129"><i>Lign.</i> 129.</a>&mdash;This name, which refers to the
fibrous structure of the shell, has been given to a fossil genus,
of which there are about thirty species in the cretaceous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402"> 402 </a></span>
and oolitic formations; and very recently four or five species
have been discovered in the Silurian strata of Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
These shells are chiefly characterized by their hinge (see
<a href="#lign_129"><i>Lign.</i> 129, <i>fig.</i> 1<i>a</i></a>.), and by the fibrous structure of their
constituent substance, which closely resembles that of the
recent <i>Pinna</i>;<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> and under the microscope is found, like
that shell, to consist of prismatic cells, filled with carbonate
of lime.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> The species vary in size from an inch to three or
four feet in diameter. The shell, in consequence of the
vertical arrangement of the fibres, readily breaks to pieces,
and it is often extremely difficult to extricate a specimen
with the hinge and beaks tolerably entire. That they were
equally brittle when recent is evident from the numerous
fragments diffused through the chalk and flint, and occasionally
imbedded in pyrites.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> The form of the hinge is
shown in <a href="#lign_129"><i>Lign.</i> 129, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>: in the lower specimen two

<p>In the Galt, or Folkstone-marl, two small species of this

the state of a white, friable earth, and readily decomposes,
leaving patches of iridescent nacre on the casts; but I have
seen examples which prove that the originals were of a
fibrous structure, like the Inocerami of the Chalk.</p>

<p>The shells of the Inocerami, like those of the oyster, and

<p><span class="smcap">Avicula.</span> <i>Lyell</i>, p. 274.&mdash;Above fifty species of this
genus of shells have been found in the British strata; their
general character will be readily understood by reference to
the pearl-oyster, (<i>Avicula margaritifera</i>,) which is so largely
imported for the manufacture of mother-of-pearl ornaments.
A remarkable species is found in the Lias, called, from the
great disproportion in the size of the shells, <i>Avicula in&aelig;quivalvis</i>,
(<i>Lyell</i>, p. 274.) The recent species are inhabitants of
warm climates.</p>

<p>Our limits will not admit of further notice of the <i>Monomyaria</i>,
and we proceed to the second division of the
plated-gilled mollusca.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dimyaria</span>: <i>Bivalve Shells, with two muscular imprints</i>.</p>

<p>The conchifera, or bivalve shells, of this group, found
fossil, are more than double in number those of the preceding;
nearly eight hundred species are known in the rocks
of Great Britain, of which by far the greater number is
marine. But we must restrict our notice of this division
to a few genera, that more space may be devoted to that
important class, the Cephalopodous Mollusca.</p>

<p>The <i>Cardium</i>, <i>Venus</i>, and Mussel shells, are familiar
examples of the <i>Dimyaria</i>. The conglomerates, now forming
in the British Channel, from accumulations of the
recent species of Cockle (<i>C. edule</i>), have been previously
noticed; see <a href="#lign_124"><i>Lign.</i> 124</a>, <a href="#Page_386">p. 386</a>. In the strata of England
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405"> 405 </a></span>
there are upwards of thirty species: the Crag contains
several, particularly a large and delicate shell, the <i>Cardium
Parkinsoni</i> (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 49). Others are peculiar to
the London clay, as the <i>Cardium semigranulatum</i>, a beautiful
shell, having the surface smooth, except on the posterior
side, which is covered with strong ridges, beset with minute
granules; it is found in many localities (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab.
144). Among the silicified shells of the Shanklin sand of
Devonshire, an elegant Cardium, <i>C. Hillanum</i>, (<i>Min. Conch.</i>
tab. 14,) occurs. But one species is known in the formations
below the Lias: the <i>Cardium striatum</i>, (<i>Murch. Sil. Syst.</i>
tab. 6, <i>fig.</i> 2,) found in the Aymestry limestone.</p>


<div class="sidenote">VENERICARDIA. PECTUNCULUS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Venericardia.</span> <i>Ly.</i> p. 199.&mdash;These shells are abundant
in the tertiary strata; one large species, <i>V. planicosta</i>, (<i>Ly.</i>
p. 199, <i>fig.</i> 171,) is found in immense quantities in the
clay and sand at Bracklesham Bay, in Sussex, from the
young to the adult state; some examples are very large,
and perfect. In the sand at Grignon, near Paris, the same
shell is abundant, possessing the usual white and delicate
aspect of the fossils of that celebrated locality of the <i>Calcaire
grossier</i>. Only one species has been noticed in the
British secondary strata.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pectunculus.</span> <i>Wond.</i> p. 244, <i>fig.</i> 8.&mdash;In the London
clay at Bracklesham Bay, Highgate, Hordwell Cliff, and in
the arenaceous limestone of Bognor rocks, an immense
number of the bivalve shells, called <i>Pectunculi</i> (<i>little pectens</i>),
occur. Some of the French marine tertiary strata also
abound in the same, and other species of this genus. In
the above-mentioned Sussex localities, these shells are so
numerous, as to be the most frequent fossils that come
under the notice of the collector. They are readily known
from their associates by their rounded equivalve shells, and
the single arched row of teeth along the hinge, resembling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406"> 406 </a></span>
the common <i>Arca</i>.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> (See <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 27). At Plumstead,
near Woolwich, a smaller species is found; and also
occasionally with the oysters at Bromley.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_366" id="Footnote_366"></a><a href="#FNanchor_366"><span class="label">[366]</span></a> The species so abundant at Bognor, is <i>P. brevirostris</i>, <i>Min. Conch.</i>
tab. 472. I have seen a block of the limestone, in which, spread
over an area of a foot square, there were upwards of fifty specimens
lying in relief.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Nucula.</span>&mdash;Several species of a small elegant bivalve,
related to the preceding, but distinguished by having two
rows of teeth on the hinge, diverging from an interspace
between the beaks, are found in the Crag and other tertiary
deposits (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 180, 192). Two species occur
in the Galt (<i>Foss. South D.</i> pl. xix. <i>fig.</i> 5, 6, 9), at Ringmer,
Folkstone, Bletchingley, &amp;c., sometimes with the shell
perfect, but generally in the state of casts composed of
indurated clay, and having impressions of the muscles and
of the two rows of hinge-teeth. The shell of one species is
marked with fine transverse grooves, or stri&aelig; (<i>N. pectinata</i>);
the other is of a flattened ovate form, and the surface
smooth (<i>N. ovata</i>).</p>

<p>The most beautiful species of Nucula are the <i>N. bivirgata</i>
of the Galt of Folkstone, and <i>F. Cobboldi&aelig;</i> of the
Norwich Crag.</p>

<p>The species of <i>Nucula</i> with the posterior side produced
into a long beak have been separated under the name
<i>Leda</i>; they have a pallial sinus, indicating a siphon to the
mantle;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pinna.</span>&mdash;The common large <i>Pinna</i>, of the Mediterranean,
is well known, and differs so entirely from other shells, as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407"> 407 </a></span>
be readily distinguished. There are about fifteen or sixteen
British fossil species. The earliest appearance of this genus
is in the Carboniferous Limestone of Derbyshire (<span class="smcap">Phil. York.</span>
tab. 6), in which there are two species. The Lias contains
one species; the Oolite eight; the Cretaceous formation
four; and the London clay two. One of the tertiary species,
<i>Pinna affinis</i> (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 313), occurs in considerable
numbers in the Bognor rocks, associated with Pectunculi;
it varies in length from one to six or seven inches. A beautiful
and delicate species is found in the <i>Calcaire grossier</i> of
Grignon. Shells of this genus are very rare in the White
Chalk, most of the supposed <i>Pinn&aelig;</i> being imperfect examples
of <i>Inocerami</i>; but I have seen specimens from Norfolk
(collected by the late Mr. Woodward), and one from Sussex,
in the cabinet of the Marquess of Northampton.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a></p>

in England. Professor Forbes informs me that it resembles <i>Pinna
conica</i> (of R&ouml;emer), and is related to <i>P. lanceolata</i> of Sowerby, but
appears to be distinct from both.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mytilus, or Mussel.</span>&mdash;There have been found about
twenty species of this well-known genus of marine shells in
the British strata. They are sparingly distributed through
the several formations, from the Silurian to the newer
Tertiary. One species (<i>Mytilus Lyellii</i>, <i>Wond.</i> p. 405, fig.
2) occurs in the Wealden, associated with fresh-water shells.</p>

<p>Of the genus termed <span class="smcap">Modiola</span>, which comprises those
mussels that have a rounded anterior termination, nearly
forty British species have been discovered; ranging through
the fossiliferous strata, from the Silurian to the Crag. A
beautiful species (<i>Modiola elegans.</i> <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 9), with
the shell generally retaining its pearly coat, is found in the
London Clay, and in the limestone of Bognor.</p>

<p>An undescribed striated <i>Modiola</i> (which may be named

106), at Puzzuoli, has afforded important and unequivocal
evidence of the physical mutations which that part of Italy
has undergone. Two species of Lithodomi have been found,
by Mr, Lonsdale, in the Oolite.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Pholadomya.</span> <i>Ly.</i> p. 272, <i>fig.</i> 290.&mdash;This genus of shells
(established by Mr. James De C. Sowerby in the Min. Conch.
1826), comprises about twenty British fossils, all of which,
with but two exceptions, occur in the Lias and Oolite.
They are equivalved shells, with the posterior end short,
and rounded, and the anterior elongated and gaping. The
surface is generally marked with ribs, or alternate elevations
and depressions, diverging obliquely from the beaks to the
margin. In the clay at Osmington and Radipole, near
Weymouth, a large species (<i>P. &aelig;qualis</i>, <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab.
546) is abundant. The Oolite of Brora, in Scotland, contains
several species. The only species found in our Chalk,
is the beautiful shell (<i>P. decussatum</i>), figured <i>Foss. South D.</i>
tab. <span class="smcap">XXV.</span> <i>fig.</i> 3, and first discovered by me, in 1820, in a
bed of Chalk Marl, which at that time was exposed at low-water,
at the base of the cliff at Brighton, near the present
entrance to the Chain-pier. The same species has since
been found at Clayton, Hamsey, Southbourne, and other
localities of the Marl.</p>


<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL PHOLADES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Pholas.</span> <a href="#lign_166"><i>Lign.</i> 166, <i>fig.</i> 5, 6.</a>&mdash;The common boring
bivalve called Pholas, must have attracted the attention of
every stroller by the sea-shore, from the numerous perforations
in blocks of chalk, and other limestones, occasioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409"> 409 </a></span>
by its operations. Some species burrow in wood, and often
commit serious ravages in piles and other submarine works
constructed of timber. In the earlier ages of our planet
we find evidence of the existence of the same kind of living
instruments for the disintegration of floating wood, and the
reduction of masses of rock into detritus. But no traces of
these shells have been found in strata below the Oolite.
One species occurs in the Coral Rag, another in the Kimmeridge
Clay; two in the Galt and Greensand; and three
or four in the tertiary deposits. In the Crag, blocks of
stone are occasionally found with the shells of <i>Pholades</i>
occupying the perforations they originally formed and
inhabited. But all the specimens I have observed in the
Galt, Greensand, and Oolite were <i>xylophagous</i> (<i>wood-eating</i>)
species. In the Shanklin Sand, masses of fossil
wood, literally honey-combed by the perforations of Pholades,
are frequent; but the shells themselves are rare. Mr.
Sowerby has figured a beautiful specimen of silicified wood,
from Sandgate, with numerous shells of this genus (<i>Pholas
priscus.</i> <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 581). <a href="#lign_166"><i>Lign.</i> 166, <i>fig.</i> 5</a>, represents
a fragment of fossil wood, with three shells <i>in situ</i>; <i>a</i>,
a shell seen longitudinally; and below, the rounded anterior
extremities of two other shells are exposed.</p>

<p>Masses of wood perforated by Pholades, from which all
traces of the shells have disappeared, have given rise to
some curious fossil remains, which are often very enigmatical
to the young collector. In the Kentish Rag, as for
example, in Mr. Bensted's quarry, near Maidstone, large
blocks of stone are found, covered with groups of subcylindrical
mammillary projections, which are obtuse or rounded
at the apex. In some examples the interstices between
these bodies are free; in others they are occupied by a reddish
brown, friable substance, presenting obscure indications
of ligneous structure: and rarely, distinct woody fibres
may be observed, the direction of which is transverse, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410"> 410 </a></span>
nearly at right angles, to the mammillated projections.
These blocks are, in truth, the stony casts of cavities formed
by Pholades, in masses of wood, both the vegetable structure,
and the shells, having perished.</p>

<p>In the White Chalk specimens of this kind are occasionally
found.</p>

<p>A remarkable fact, relating to some of the specimens
from the Iguanodon quarry, remains to be mentioned. Upon
breaking off the projections, to ascertain if any traces of
the shells of the Pholades remained, we discovered in
several, near the apex, a univalve shell, a species of <i>Nerita</i>.
<a href="#lign_166"><i>Lign.</i> 166, <i>fig.</i> 6</a>, represents a fragment of stone with two of
the casts, which have been broken, and in each, at <i>a</i>, a
univalve is imbedded. At <i>b</i>, the ligneous structure of the
original wood is visible. The only hypothesis that will
account for the appearance of these univalves in their
present position, is that of supposing that the Nerites
crawled into the cavities made in the mass of timber, after
the shells of the Pholades had been removed; and that the
wood became imbedded in a sand-bank, and the univalves
enclosed in the cavities; the ligneous structure in a great
measure perished, and the stony casts of the perforations of
the borers, with the imprisoned univalves, remained. The
Nerites, as shown in the example figured, do not occupy
any particular position in the tubes; one has the apex
towards the end of the cavity, and the other lies in a transverse
direction.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

lithodomi.</p></div>


<div class="sidenote">TEREDO.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Teredo.</span> <i>Ly.</i> p. 24.&mdash;It will be convenient to notice
in this place another genus of boring shells, whose fossil
remains are far more abundant than those of the Pholas.
The <i>Teredo navalis</i>, or Ship-worm, which is the most vermiform
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411"> 411 </a></span>
of all the mollusca, forms tortuous cylindrical
hollows in wood; and in some climates commits the most
extensive injuries to ships, the piles of harbours, bridges,
and other submarine works formed of timber. A reference
to the illustration given by Sir C. Lyell will render detailed
description unnecessary. The <i>Teredo</i> is furnished at one
extremity with testaceous valves, by which it bores its way
into the wood, while from the surface of its soft body a
calcareous matter is secreted, which lines with a shelly
covering the hollows or channels formed by the animal in
its progress. The fossil species differ from the recent in the
valves being united to the calcareous tube. Wood perforated
by <i>Teredines</i>, and occupied by their shelly tubes, occurs in
almost every locality of the London Clay. Those specimens
in which the wood is petrified, and the cavities of the tubes
are filled with calcareous spar of various colours, furnish
beautiful sections, when cut and polished (<i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl.
viii. <i>fig.</i> 8, 9). When the canal in the Regent's Park was
being formed, large blocks of perforated calcareous wood
were discovered, having the ligneous structure well preserved,
and the tubes of the Teredines occupied by yellow, grey,
and brown spar, forming specimens of great beauty and
interest. Wood, with Teredines, or some analogous boring
mollusks, occurs sparingly in the chalk of this country;
but in the cretaceous strata at Maestricht, large masses are
frequently found.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> Fossil wood may occasionally be observed
with perforations that have been made by other
kinds of boring shells; but the preceding remarks will
suffice to convey an idea of the nature and origin of such
appearances.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_369" id="Footnote_369"></a><a href="#FNanchor_369"><span class="label">[369]</span></a> In the British Museum there is a mass of silicified wood from
the Upper Greensand of Blackdown, perforated by a Teredo, whose

<p><a name="Footnote_370" id="Footnote_370"></a><a href="#FNanchor_370"><span class="label">[370]</span></a> Other genera of boring shells also occur fossil, as Fistulana,

<p><span class="smcap">Trigonia.</span> <a href="#lign_127"><i>Lign.</i> 127, <i>fig.</i> 1, 2, 4.</a>&mdash;These bivalves are
related to the <i>Arcade&aelig;</i> and <i>Nucul&aelig;</i>, but distinguished by
the peculiar character of the hinge; the right valve has
two large oblong teeth, which diverge from the umbo, and
are strongly furrowed, and fit into two corresponding grooved
cavities, in the opposite, or left valve. These shells are very
thick and nacreous; they abound in certain strata of the
Oolite and lower Cretaceous formation, but have not been observed
in any deposits of this country older than the Lias;
there are nearly thirty British species. Two living species
of Trigonia (<i>Trigonia margaritacea</i> and <i>T. Jukesii</i>) are
known, both inhabitants of the seas of New Holland, where
they are associated with Terebratul&aelig;. Some of the argillaceous
beds of the Oolite, as the Oxford and Kimmeridge
clays, abound in Trigoni&aelig;; Osmington and Radipole, near
Weymouth, are celebrated localities for these fossil shells,
which are found there in great perfection; and on the
French coast, where similar strata appear, the Trigoni&aelig; are
equally abundant. Under the cliffs, near Boulogne harbour,
the shore is strewn with them. Three common species are
figured in <a href="#lign_127"><i>Lign.</i> 127</a>. The casts of most of the species are
smooth, as in <i>fig.</i> 2; and the collector should, therefore,
search for impressions of the outer surface, when the shell
is absent, as is generally the case in the Portland Oolite and
Shanklin Sand, in which Trigoni&aelig; are very numerous.
Near Highworth, in Wiltshire, very fine and large examples
of <i>Trigonia costata</i>, <i>fig.</i> 4, occur, with the shell preserved.
The impressions of the large, oblong, diverging teeth of the
hinge, are usually so strongly marked in the casts, as to
render it easy to identify the shells of this genus. The
quarries of the Portland Oolite at Swindon, Wilts, teem
with casts of Trigoni&aelig;, collocated with Ammonites. In the
Isle of Portland they are also very numerous, some beds of
stone being so friable, from the numerous cavities left by
the removal of the substance of the shells, as to be unfit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413"> 413 </a></span>
for paving, or other economical purposes. Very sharp casts
may be obtained from this rock by merely breaking the
stone to pieces. In the Whetstone of Blackdown, Devon,
beautiful silicified Trigoni&aelig; are occasionally found. Tisbury,
in Wiltshire, yields very fine specimens, and in some examples,
Mr. G. B. Sowerby has detected remains of the
ligament.</p>


<p class="caption3">FOSSIL FRESH-WATER BIVALVES.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL FRESH-WATER BIVALVES.</div>

<p>The animals of the shells hitherto described are, with
scarcely any exception, inhabitants of the sea; and the
marine origin of the strata in which they occur, may consequently
be inferred, with but little probability of error. I
now propose noticing the fossil remains of those bivalves
which inhabit rivers, lakes, streams, and pools of fresh
water. The marine, or fresh-water, character of fossil shells,
is inferred from their resemblance to the recent mollusca,
whose habits are known; for the shells alone present no unequivocal
marks, by which even the experienced conchologist
can pronounce whether an extinct form belonged to a marine
or to a fluviatile mollusk, although certain characters may
admit of an approximative inference. Thus, for instance, as
none of the known living fresh-water bivalves belong to the
previous division, the <i>Monomyaria</i>, the presence in a stratum
of numerous shells with but one muscular impression,
would afford a fair presumption of the marine origin of such,
deposit. The remains with which the shells are associated
and the mineralogical characters of the strata in which they
occur, would, of course, afford important corroborative
evidence.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

marine deposits. <i>Ly.</i> p. 27, <i>et seq.</i></p></div>

<p>The living fresh-water bivalves comprise but a few genera
and species; and those which have been found fossil in the
British strata belong to but four or five genera. Their distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414"> 414 </a></span>
is restricted to strata of undoubted fluviatile
origin, and to those local intercalations of fresh-water and
land productions in marine deposits, which occur in some
of the secondary, and in many of the tertiary formations.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Unio.</span> <i>Ly.</i> p. 28.&mdash;The river Mussels, or <i>Unionid&aelig;</i>, have
a solid, pearly shell, with two principal and two lateral
teeth on the hinge; and their umbones, or bosses, are generally
smooth, or longitudinally undulated. Those which
have no cardinal teeth are arranged under the genus
<i>Anodon</i>: but it is not necessary for our present purpose, to
enter into minute conchological distinctions. In number,
variety, and beauty, the species which inhabit the large
rivers of North America present a striking contrast with
the few and homely British fresh-water mussels; nor have
we, in a fossil state, any shells of this family at all comparable
with those living types.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The earliest fossil Mollusca
referred to the genus <i>Unio</i> appear in certain layers of clay
and argillaceous ironstone belonging to the Carboniferous
system of Derbyshire, Coalbrook Dale, &amp;c. (<i>Min. Conch.</i>
vol. i. tab. 33). In the former county, these strata are
termed <i>mussel-band</i>;<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> and some beds constitute a compact
shell-limestone, which admits of being manufactured into
vases, &amp;c., and takes a good polish; the sections of the shells
in this marble are white, on a dark ground. There is, however,
considerable doubt whether any of the Carboniferous
shells really belong to the genus <i>Unio</i>; some geologists
refer them to <i>Cardinia</i>, a group of sea-shells found especially
in the Lias.</p>

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL SHELLS OF GASTEROPODA.</p>

<p>The univalve shells, as we have previously explained, are
the calcareous cases, or coverings, of a more highly organized
class of molluscous animals, than the inhabitants of the
bivalves (see <a href="#Page_366">p. 366</a>.), for they possess a head and mouth
with jaws, eyes, and feelers; and while the <i>Acephala</i>, with
but few exceptions, are incapable of locomotion, the <i>Encephala</i>
are almost all of them furnished with organs of progression,
and can creep, climb, and swim, or float on the
surface of the water. Their shells are for the most part
formed of one valve, hence the name of <i>univalve</i>; but in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418"> 418 </a></span>
some species it is composed of several pieces. The most
simple form of shell is that of the hollow cone, of which the
<i>Patella</i>, or limpet, affords an example; and in the more
complicated modifications, the cone is twisted, or convoluted
spirally, either in the same plane as in the <i>Planorbis</i> of our
rivers, or obliquely, as in by far the greater number of
species. The direction of the spire is generally from left
to right, the aperture being dextral to the observer when
the shell is placed with its apex uppermost, as in <a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i> 133,
<i>figs.</i> 1, 2, 3</a>; but in a few species the spire turns in the
opposite manner, and the mouth or aperture is to the left,
or sinistral, as in <a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i> 133, <i>fig.</i> 4</a>. In consequence of the
form of the aperture of the shell, the entire or notched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419"> 419 </a></span>
condition of its margin, and the presence or absence of a
canal or siphon always having relation to the soft parts of
the animal, these characters afford data by which the genera
and species of the shells may be determined, and information
obtained as to the structure and economy of the
originals.</p>

<p>The Gasteropoda generally creep by means of a fleshy
disk, or foot, which is situated under the belly. Some kinds
are terrestrial, others inhabit trees, many live in rivers and
streams, others in stagnant and brackish waters; but the
greater number are denizens of the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL GASTEROPODA.</div>

<p>The Common Snail, River Snail, and Periwinkle, are
instances of terrestrial, fluviatile, and marine forms. The
organs of respiration are situated in the last whorl of the
shell; and in some genera the border of the mantle, or
integument surrounding the body, is prolonged into a siphon,
by which the water is freely admitted, without the head or
foot being protruded: in these mollusks the shell has a corresponding
channel to receive the siphon, as in the Whelk,
or Buccinum, and in the fossil shell <a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i> 133, <i>fig.</i> 4</a>. The
Gasteropoda are generally provided with an operculum, or
movable valve, by which the aperture is closed and defended
when the animal retreats within its shell. In some species
the operculum is a mere horny pellicle; in others it is a
solid calcareous plate of considerable relative thickness.
These mollusca, as is but too well known of the terrestrial
species, consume large quantities of food. Some are herbivorous,
and others carnivorous; many prey on living, and
others on decaying animal and vegetable substances.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420"> 420 </a></span>
in a fossil state the shells alone remain to afford any clue
as to the structure and economy of the originals, characters
have been sought for, by which the fluviatile or marine
nature, and the carnivorous or herbivorous habits of the
living mollusca may be determined. As a general rule, it
will be found, that the shells of terrestrial and fresh-water
Gasteropoda have the aperture entire, as in the Garden Snail,
and in the fossil shell, <a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i> 133, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>; and that a large
proportion of the marine species have the opening notched
or channelled, as in the Whelk, and <a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i> 133, <i>figs.</i> 3, 4</a>;
and most of the species with entire apertures are herbivorous.
But these inferences must be regarded in a very
general sense, and it will require corroborative evidence to
establish the marine or fresh-water nature of those fossil
shells which do not bear a close analogy to known living
species.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_378" id="Footnote_378"></a><a href="#FNanchor_378"><span class="label">[378]</span></a> "All <i>Gasteropoda</i> commence life under the same form, both of
shell and animal, namely, a very simple helicoid shell, and an animal
furnished with two ciliated wings or lobes, by which it can swim
freely through the fluid in which it is contained. At this stage of
existence the animal corresponds to the permanent state of the
<i>Pteropod</i>, and the form is alike, whether it be afterwards a shelled or
a shell-less species."&mdash;Prof. E. Forbes, Edin. Philos. Journal, vol.

<p>The various conditions in which the remains of univalve
shells occur in the mineral kingdom have already been so
fully explained, that but a few additional remarks on that
subject are required (see <a href="#Page_382">p. 382</a>.).</p>

<p>The Gasteropoda are found to progressively diminish in
number with the antiquity of the deposits, and it was once
supposed that this type of molluscous organization was not
contemporaneous with the ancient Cephalopoda. My discovery
of several genera associated with Ammonites in the
chalk (see <i>Foss. South D.</i> pl. xviii, xix) first tended to
invalidate this hypothesis; and the subsequent researches of
Dr. Fitton, Professor Phillips, and other geologists have
shown that the presence or absence of Gasteropoda in a
stratum may generally be ascribed to the circumstance of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421"> 421 </a></span>
the deposit having been formed in shallow, or in deep water.
Thus when simple univalves largely predominate under
circumstances that indicate they were imbedded in their
native habitats, it may be safely concluded that the rock is
of littoral formation; or, in other words, was deposited in
shallow water, near the sea-shore; and, on the contrary,
when Nautili, Ammonites, and the shells of other mollusca
known to live in deep waters abound in a formation, it may
be presumed that the strata were formed in the tranquil
depths of the ocean. The number of described species from
the British strata is nearly eight hundred; and these are
distributed throughout the sedimentary formations, from
the Silurian to the newest Tertiary; the latter containing
by far the greater proportion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL FRESH-WATER UNIVALVES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fresh-water Univalves.</span>&mdash;The fossil shells of Gasteropoda
that are undoubtedly fluviatile, comprise but few
genera and species, and are confined to those deposits, which,
from the corroborative proofs afforded by other organic
remains, are unquestionably of fresh-water origin. Such
are the intercalated beds of clay and limestone in the
London and Paris basins, the Wealden formation, and
certain strata in the Carboniferous system. The most
numerous specimens are principally referable to the common
fluviatile genera, <i>Paludina</i>, <i>Limn&aelig;a</i>, <i>Planorbis</i>, and <i>Melanopsis</i>
(see <i>Ly.</i> p. 29).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paludina.</span> <i>Lign. 133, fig. 1.</i> (<i>Wond.</i> p. 401, <i>Ly.</i> p. 29.)&mdash;This
common river shell is of a conoidal form, and the
whorls of the spire, and the aperture, are rounded. Eleven
British species are known. In the tertiary fresh-water beds
of Headon Hill, at Alum Bay, Paludin&aelig; with the shells
perfect, and of a dull white colour, are abundant; and also
in the limestone at Shalcombe, in the Isle of Wight, in the
state of casts. In both these localities the Paludin&aelig; are
associated with other fresh-water shells. But the grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422"> 422 </a></span>
deposit of shells of this genus is the Wealden formation;
throughout which there are extensive beds of marble, coarse
limestone, and clays, almost wholly composed of Paludin&aelig;,
and minute fresh-water Crustaceans, of the genus <i>Cypris</i>,
which will be described in a subsequent chapter. The compact
paludina-limestone of Sussex, called Petworth or Sussex
marble, is principally made up of one species, the <i>P. fluviorum</i>,
<a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i> 133, <i>fig.</i> 1</a>, and is an aggregation of Paludin&aelig;,
held together by crystallized carbonate of lime; the cavities
of the shells, and their interstices, being often filled with
white calcareous spar. A polished slab, displaying sections
of the enclosed shells, is figured in <i>Wond.</i> p. 402. Upon
examining slices of this marble with the microscope, the
cavities of the shells are found to contain myriads of the
cases of Cyprides.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The Wealden limestone of the Isle of
Purbeck, <a href="#lign_134"><i>Lign.</i> 134</a>,
known as Purbeck
marble, is, in like
manner, composed
of Paludin&aelig;, but of
a much smaller species.
Both these
marbles were in
great repute with
the architects of the
middle ages, and
there are but few of our cathedrals and ancient churches
which do not still contain examples, either in their columns,
monuments, or pavements, of one or both varieties. The
polished marble columns of Chichester Cathedral, and those
of the Temple Church, in London, are of Purbeck marble;
in other words, they are composed of the petrified shells of
snails, that lived and died in a river, flowing through a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423"> 423 </a></span>
country inhabited by the Iguanodon and other colossal
reptiles, all of which have long since become extinct. With
the exception of the <i>mussel-band</i> limestone of the Carboniferous
system, previously described, these are the only British
fresh-water marbles<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> There are four species of Paludina

fresh-water mollusks inhabit our lakes and ponds, and may
be known by their pointed spire, elongated oval body, and
delicate thin shell: on the inner lip of the aperture there is
an oblique fold. Fossil shells of this genus are found with
Paludin&aelig; in the fresh-water tertiary deposits. Headon
Hill and other localities in the Isle of Wight abound in
these shells; and in the limestone of Calbourn beautiful
casts are very numerous. The Paris basin yields several
species; and there are six species in the Isle of Wight
Tertiary; I have not observed any decided examples in the
Wealden. In the sands and clays the shells are well preserved;
in the limestones the casts only remain. Shells of
another genus of fresh-water spiral univalves, termed <i>Bulimus</i>
(<i>Ly.</i> p. 30), are found associated with the above. A
large species (<i>B. ellipticus</i>, <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 337), occurs
in the limestone at Binstead, near Ryde, and at Calbourn;
I have collected specimens two inches long from the former

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425"> 425 </a></span></p>

<p>The animals of these shells are characterized by their respiratory
organs, which are formed of one or two pectiniform
gills, with a tube or siphon more or less elongated, for the
free admission of sea-water to the branchial apparatus. This
organization is indicated in the shell, either by a notch, or
by a prolonged tubular canal. All the species are, with
scarcely any exceptions, inhabitants of the sea, and carnivorous.</p>

<p>I have selected for illustration of the genus <i>Fusus</i>, a celebrated
shell of the Crag, known among collectors as the
"<i>Esssex reversed Whelk</i>," <a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i> 133, <i>fig.</i> 4</a>; the spire is
twisted in the opposite direction to the usual mode, and the
mouth is consequently to the left of the observer; the same
species occurs with the spire in the common direction. The
shells of the genus <i>Pleurotoma</i> are distinguished by an
incision, or notch, in the side of the right or outer lip; and
those of <i>Cerithium</i>, by the form of the mouth, see <a href="#lign_133"><i>Lign.</i>
133, <i>fig.</i> 3</a>. The latter is a very numerous genus, and more
than two hundred fossil species are enumerated; it contains
many elegant forms. The Tertiary strata at Grignon are
particularly rich in these fossils; the shells are of a pearly
whiteness, and as perfect as when recent. Some Cerithia
are of considerable size; the <i>C. giganteum</i> is from ten to
fourteen inches in length. The genus <span class="smcap">Potamides</span> comprehends
shells closely resembling the Cerithia in form, but
which are inhabitants of fresh-water.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> This is an instance
of the difficulty which sometimes exists of arriving at
certain conclusions as to the habits of the mollusks, from
their testaceous coverings alone.</p>

when <i>fossil</i>, by the absence of <i>varices</i>, or "periodic mouths." The
recent species are known to be inhabitants of fresh-water, by their
dark epidermis, corroded points, and horny multi-spiral <i>opercula</i>.</p></div>

<p>The Plastic Clay beds at Castle Hill, Newhaven, and in
the vicinity of Woolwich, abound in two species of shells,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426"> 426 </a></span>
which were originally described by Mr. Sowerby, as <i>Cerithia</i>
(viz. <i>C. funatum</i> and <i>C. melanoides</i>),<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> but are now
referred to the fresh-water genus, Melania; by some conchologists
to <i>Potamides</i>. At Castle Hill they are accompanied
by fresh-water bivalves, and leaves of dicotyledonous
plants.</p>

near Hurstpierpoint, in Sussex. This species is distinguished
by its transverse tuberculated bands; it is a very rare production
of the lower chalk of Sussex (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 326).
Turbinated shells related to <i>Trochus</i>, and belonging to
several genera, occur in the Cretaceous deposits. As is the

<p>There are two species of this genus (formerly named
<i>Cirrus</i> by Mr. Sowerby) which are of frequent occurrence
in the White Chalk of England, in the state of casts, and
are figured in my <i>Foss. South D.</i> tab. xviii., under the
names of <i>Cirrus perspectivus</i>, and <i>Trochus linearis</i>. The
Chalk Marl of Sussex yields in some localities (Hamsey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429"> 429 </a></span>

extinct genus are deeply umbilicated, discoidal, spiral
univalves, having the innermost whorls of the shell divided
by imperforated partitions. The internal structure of these
shells will serve to prepare the student for those more complicated
forms of the testaceous apparatus presented by the
Cephalopoda, which will form the subject of the next
chapter. There are several recent univalves the animals of
which retreat in the progress of growth from the apex of
the spire, and the vacated portion is shut off by a shelly
plate. In some genera a series of concave septa are thus
formed; but in others (as <i>Magilus</i>) the deserted cavity is
filled by a compact accretion of calcareous matter, and a
solid elongated shell is produced. The <i>Euomphalus</i>, of
which there are many species in the Silurian, Devonian, and
Carboniferous strata, belongs to the former group. As the
animal increased in size, it deserted the smaller and innermost
portion of the spire, and a nacreous partition was
secreted by the posterior part of the mantle, the interspace
remaining hollow; as this process was repeated at different
periods, several cells were successively formed. This chambered
structure is shown in the specimen <a href="#lign_136"><i>Lign.</i> 136, <i>fig.</i> 2</a>,
in which the cells are filled with spar, but the outer cavity
is occupied by limestone like that in which the shell was
imbedded; a proof that no communication existed between
the chamber occupied by the body of the animal, and the
space from which it had withdrawn. The calcareous spar,
as in the vegetable remains previously described (<a href="#Page_71">p. 71</a>.), has
percolated the substance of the fossil, and crystallized in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430"> 430 </a></span>
the innermost cells. We shall again have occasion to refer
to this interesting fact, when investigating the chambered
cells of the Cephalopoda. It may be necessary to remark,
that it does not appear that the vacant interspaces in the

<p>This substance is of a dark brown or black colour, and
occurs either in shapeless masses, which are irregularly
distributed among the shells and other organic remains, in
sandstone, limestone, &amp;c., or as casts of shells, or occupying
their cavities, as in the specimen <a href="#lign_139"><i>Lign.</i> 139, <i>fig.</i> 3</a>, which is
a vertical section of a spiral univalve (<i>Rostellaria</i>), filled
with the soft parts of the animal, converted into molluskite.
Upon analysis this substance is found to contain a large
proportion of animal carbon.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The rocks of firestone at
Southbourne, on the Sussex coast, are mottled with brown
molluskite and hard amorphous concretions, consisting of
carbon and phosphate of lime, mixed with sand and other
extraneous matter. Casts of shells, of the genera Venus,
<i>Arca</i>, &amp;c., entirely composed of the same kind of materials,
are also abundant in those rocks. The lowermost bed of
Galt, at its line of junction with the Greensand beneath, at
Folkstone, and in many other localities, is largely composed
of similar matter, resembling in appearance the fossils called
Coprolites, hereafter described. The outer chamber of the
Ammonites and other shells, so abundant in the Galt, are
often filled with this substance. But the most interesting
deposit of molluskite is in the Kentish Rag of Mr. Bensted's
quarry, near Maidstone. This phenomenon had not escaped
the notice of that intelligent and accurate observer, who
liberally placed at my disposal numerous shells, particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434"> 434 </a></span>
of <i>Trigoni&aelig;</i> and <i>Terebratul&aelig;</i>, which were filled with molluskite,
and large slabs of the sandstone, full of concretionary
and amorphous masses of the same. The latter,
Mr. Bensted suggested, may have been derived from the soft
bodies of the dead Mollusks, which, having become disengaged
from their shells and aggregated together, had floated in
the sea, until they became enveloped in the sand and mud,
which have gradually consolidated into the arenaceous stone
termed Kentish Rag, In illustration of this opinion, Mr.
Bensted directed my attention to the following remarkable
fact, related in the <i>American Journal of Science</i>:&mdash;In the
year 1836, a fatal epidemic prevailed among the shell-fish of
the Muskingum River, in the state of Ohio. It commenced
in April, and continued until June, destroying millions of
the mollusca that inhabited the beds of the tributary streams,
and the river. As the animals died, the valves of the shells
opened, and, decomposition commencing, the muscular adhesions
gave way, and the fleshy portions rose to the surface
of the water, leaving the shells in the bed of the river. As
masses of the dead bodies floated down the current, the
headlands of islands, piles of drifted wood, and the shores
of the river, in many places, were covered with them; and
the air in the vicinity was tainted with the putrid effluvium
exhaling from these accumulations of decomposing animal
matter. The cause of the epidemic was unknown.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_391" id="Footnote_391"></a><a href="#FNanchor_391"><span class="label">[391]</span></a> Some of this <i>molluskite</i> has, at my request, been analyzed by
Mr. Rigg, who obliged me with the following remarks:&mdash;"After
removing the lime by means of hydrochloric acid from ten grains of
this substance, there remained 1.2 grain of dark powder, which gave,
by analysis with oxide of copper, .16 of a cubic inch of carbonic acid,
and a small portion of nitrogen. On subjecting to the same kind of
analysis two grains of the darker body, without previously acting
upon it by any acid, .054 of a cubic inch of carbonic acid was
obtained; so that from these results there is no doubt but the darker
portion of the molluskite contains about .35 per cent, of its weight of
carbon in an organized state."</p></div>

<p>"Now nearly the whole of the shells in the beds of
Kentish Rag," Mr. Bensted remarks, "have their shells open,
as if they were dead before their envelopment in the deposit.
And, from the large quantity of water-worn fragments
of wood perforated by Pholades imbedded with them, it seems
probable that this stratum had originally been a sand-bank
covered with drifted wood and shells, thus presenting a very
analogous condition to the phenomenon above described."
The gelatinous bodies of the <i>Trigoni&aelig;</i>, <i>Ostre&aelig;</i>, <i>Rostellari&aelig;</i>,
<i>Terebratul&aelig;</i>, &amp;c., detached from their shells, may have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435"> 435 </a></span>
intermingled with the drifted wood in a sand-bank; while,
in some instances, the animal matter would remain in the
shells, be converted into molluskite, and retain the form of
the original, as in the spiral univalve, represented in section,
<a href="#lign_139"><i>Lign.</i> 139, <i>fig.</i> 3</a>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A microscopical examination of the Maidstone molluskite
detects, with a low power, innumerable portions of the nacreous
lamin&aelig; of shells, intermingled with the carbonaceous
matter, many siliceous spicula of Sponges, minute spines
of Echinoderms, and fragments of Corals; these extraneous
bodies probably became entangled among the floating animal
matter. A large proportion of the shelly lamin&aelig;, examined
with a high power, displays the peculiar structure of the
<i>Terebratul&aelig;</i> (see <a href="#lign_126"><i>Lign.</i> 126, <i>fig.</i> 2<sup><i>a</i></sup></a>), of which several species
are abundant in the Kentish Rag.</p>

<p>The dark masses and veins so common in the Sussex and
Purbeck marbles are produced by molluskite. If at the
period of their envelopment the shells were empty, they
became filled either with grey marl and limestone, or with
white calcareous spar; but if they enclosed the bodies of
the Mollusks, the soft mass was changed into carbonaceous
matter; and in polished sections of the marble, the <i>molluskite</i>
appears either in black or dark brown spots, or fills up
the cavities of the shells. The dark blotches and veins
observable in the fine pillars of Purbeck marble in the
Temple Church, London, are produced by molluskite; and
the most beautiful slabs of Sussex marble owe their appearance
to the contrast produced by this black substance in
contact with white calcareous spar.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Distribution of the Bivalve and Univalve

may be regarded as the "Medals of Creation," the fossil
testaceous mollusca, from their durability, numbers and
variety, may be considered as the current coin of Geology.
Occurring in the most ancient fossiliferous strata in small
numbers, and of peculiar types,&mdash;becoming more abundant
and varied in the secondary formations,&mdash;and increasing
prodigiously, both numerically and specifically, in the tertiary,
these relics are of inestimable value in the identification
of a stratum in distant regions, and in the determination
of the relative age of a series of deposits. To the solution
of the former problem the sagacity of the late Dr. William
Smith first suggested their applicability;<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> while the idea,
so happily conceived, and so philosophically candied out, by
Sir C. Lyell, of arranging that heretofore chaotic mass of
deposits, termed the Tertiary, into groups, by the relative
number of recent and extinct species of shells, demonstrated
the important aid to be derived from this class of organic
remains, in the determination of some of the most difficult
questions in geological science.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441"> 441 </a></span></p>

<p>I have reserved for especial mention in this place, the
work, which will afford the student of British fossil Conchology
the most important aid in the identification of specimens,
namely, the "<i>Mineral Conchology of Great Britain</i>,"
by the late eminent naturalist, Mr. <span class="smcap">James Sowerby</span>, and
continued by his son, Mr. James De Carle Sowerby; in six
volumes 8vo., with several hundred coloured plates. Unfortunately,
this work has long been discontinued; and the
rapid progress of discovery, and the numerous foreign publications
on every department of fossil conchology, almost
forbid the hope that it will be resumed by the present proprietor.
Although the high price of this work places it
beyond the reach of many individuals, it will be found in
most libraries of Natural History.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ON COLLECTING FOSSIL SHELLS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On the Collection and Arrangement of Fossil Shells.</span>&mdash;The
instructions already given for the collection of corals,
echinoderms, &amp;c., will have familiarized the student with the
methods generally adopted, and render it unnecessary to
enter into much detail. The shells in arenaceous deposits,
particularly in those of the Tertiary formations, are commonly
so perfect, as merely to require careful removal:
those in the clays are more fragile, and must be extracted
with great caution; and, when very delicate, should be left
attached to the clay or shale. The specimens extracted
entire may be kept either in paper trays, lined with wadding,
or fixed to pieces of card or thin board covered with paper,
by thick gum-water; three or four specimens being attached
in different positions, so as to expose the essential characters,
as the aperture, spire, and back of the univalves, and the
hinge, muscular imprints, &amp;c. of the bivalves. Where only
casts remain, search should be made for an impression of the
outer surface of the shell, and a cast taken of it in wax,
kneaded bread, or plaster of Paris. In indurated clays, sometimes
both shells and casts may be obtained; and a specimen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442"> 442 </a></span>
of each should be preserved. Mastic varnish, or solution of
gum tragacanth, delicately applied to fragile shells, tends to
preserve them, and improves their appearance. It is desirable
to collect the same species in various states of growth;
the form of the young shell (as in <i>Rostellaria ampla</i>, of
Solander) often differing essentially from that of the adult.
It will be found convenient to have trays or boards of
different colours; and to select one tint for the shells collected
from a particular formation, or deposit; for example,
the newer Tertiary may be placed on yellow paper; the
older, or Eocene fossils, on light-blue. It is also desirable
to separate the marine from the fresh-water species.</p>

<p>Shells imbedded in chalk, limestone, &amp;c., often require
much labour to display their more delicate and important
characters. For clearing chalk specimens, a stout penknife,
and a few gravers or gouges of various sizes, will be necessary;
and by a little practice, the spines of the Spondylus
(<a href="#lign_128"><i>Lign.</i> 128</a>), and the beaks and hinge of Inocerami (<a href="#lign_129"><i>Lign.</i>
129</a>), &amp;c., may be readily exposed. A small stiffish brush,
used with water, is also serviceable. The shells in compact
stone, as those of the mountain limestone, must generally be
cleared with the hammer and chisel. Common species may
be broken out, and, from several examples, probably one or
two will be found perfect; but choice and rare specimens
should not be thus risked; they will amply repay the trouble
of the less expeditious method of chiselling away the surrounding
stone. Casts may be taken in gutta percha, &amp;c.</p>

<p>To determine the names of the specimens that he has
collected should be the next care of the student. No
method will so readily initiate the young collector in fossil
conchology, as the careful examination of a small series of
the common species, with their names attached.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> By the

and the remarks previously advanced on the prevailing
shells of each formation, will afford a general idea of the
genera to which they belong; and, by referring to the
figures quoted, the specific names may be determined.</p>

surface were accurately adjusted. The chalk has been chiselled away
in the supposed longitudinal direction of the enclosed extraneous
body, and part of the scaly surface of a fish has been thus brought to
light. A portion of chalk has also been removed towards both ends,
with the view of ascertaining the extent and direction of the fossil;
and at each place indications of its presence are visible.</td>

  <td class="tdl">Represents the specimen completely developed. It proves to be a fish
almost perfect, lying on its back, with the body uncompressed, the
mouth open, the arches and opercula of the gills expanded, and the
dorsal, pectoral, and ventral fins entire. The caudal fin, or tail, is
imperfect. The original is nine inches long, and is one of the most
extraordinary fossil fishes ever discovered. It belongs to the Salmon
family, and is allied to the Osmerus, or Smelt; it is now in the British
Museum. We thus perceive that the oval markings on the surface of
fig. 1 were occasioned by the section of the scales covering the cylindrical
body of the fish (see <a href="#Page_627">p. 627</a>). A magnified view of one of the
scales is figured <a href="#lign_185"><i>Lign.</i> 185</a>, <i>fig.</i> 4, <a href="#Page_567">p. 567</a>.</td>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> molluscous animals named <i>Cephalopoda</i> (from their
organs of prehension being arranged around the upper part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448"> 448 </a></span>
of the body) are the most ancient, numerous, and interesting
of this division of animated nature; and their fossil remains
comprehend the most varied and striking forms of extinct
beings that occur in the sedimentary strata, from the earliest
Secondary to the latest Tertiary formations. The living
species are but a feeble representation of the countless
myriads which swarmed in the ancient seas; yet they
afford important assistance in developing the characters of
the numerous extinct genera, whose relics abound in the
strata, and will continually be presented to the observation
of the collector. It is therefore necessary to enter somewhat
in detail on the structure of these beings, that the
student may obtain a correct idea of the nature of the
curious fossils to which the mineralized remains of the
durable parts of these animals have given rise, and whose
origin has but lately been correctly ascertained. The body
of these mollusca is either enclosed in a shell, as in the
<i>Nautilus</i>, or contains a calcareous or cartilaginous part, as
in the <i>Sepia</i>, or cuttle-fish; they have a distinct head, and
eyes as perfect as in the vertebrate animals; complicated
organs of hearing; and a powerful manducatory apparatus,
surrounded by arms serving for prehension. They have
below the head a tube which acts as a locomotive instrument
to propel the animal backwards, by the forcible ejection
of the water that has served the purposes of respiration, and
which can be thrown out with considerable force by the
contraction of the body. The figures 1 and 6, <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>,
are views of a naked (that is, <i>shell-less</i>) cephalopod, showing
the arms, eyes, and a pair of fins, for swimming. The Cephalopoda,
thus endowed with powerful organs of locomotion,
traverse the seas unrestricted, and are seen in groups of
myriads in the midst of the ocean, and only appear periodically
near the shores. Their fossil remains consist of&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. The external shells; which are generally symmetrical,
and either straight (as in <i>Orthoceras</i>, <a href="#lign_155"><i>Lign.</i> 155</a>); arched or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449"> 449 </a></span>
bent (as in <i>Crioceras</i>, <a href="#lign_160"><i>Lign.</i> 160</a>); spiral (as in <i>Turrilites</i>,
<a href="#lign_163"><i>Lign.</i> 163</a>); or involute,<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and simple (as in the <i>Argonaut</i>),
or divided, by smooth or foliaceous partitions, into chambers
or air-cells, connected by a hydraulic tube or siphuncle (as
in <i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Lign.</i> <a href="#lign_149">149</a> and <a href="#lign_150">150</a>, and <i>Ammonites</i>, <a href="#lign_156"><i>Lign.</i> 156

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_399" id="Footnote_399"></a><a href="#FNanchor_399"><span class="label">[399]</span></a> <i>Involute</i>, as applied to the shells of Cephalopoda, implies that

the inner turns apparent, or exposed; <i>evolute</i>, the whorls coiled in

<p>3dly. The ink-bladder, with its inspissated contents,
termed <i>sepia</i>.</p>

<p>4thly. The mandibles of the mouth, or beaks, called
<i>Rhyncholites</i>. (<a href="#lign_150"><i>Lign.</i> 150</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1.)</p>

<p>5thly. The soft parts of the animal in the state of molluskite;
impressions of the head and tentacula, and remains
of the clasps or curved hooks of the arms of some species
(see <i>Lign.</i> <a href="#lign_140">140</a> and <a href="#lign_145">145</a>).</p>

<p>These several parts are generally found separate, but they
sometimes occur in their proper relative position, and from
such examples the nature of the original may be determined.</p>

<p>The Cephalopoda<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> are divided into two orders, according
to the number of their organs of respiration, or gills;
namely, the <i>Dibranchiata</i>, or those which have two gills,
(called also <i>Acetabulifera</i>, from their arms being furnished
with rows of little cups or suckers;) and the <i>Tetrabranchiata</i>,
which have four gills, or branchi&aelig;, and very numerous arms
without suckers.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_401" id="Footnote_401"></a><a href="#FNanchor_401"><span class="label">[401]</span></a> The best systematic account of the Cephalopoda and Gasteropoda,

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL DIBRANCHIATE CEPHALOPODA.</p>

<p>The <i>Argonaut</i>, or Paper Nautilus, whose elegant fragile
shell is too well known to require description, is the only
living genus of this Order, in which the animal is protected
by a hard calcareous external covering. This shell is symmetrical,
and convoluted on a vertical plane, and consists
of but one cavity or chamber. The other genera are naked,
and possess an internal chambered shell (as in the recent
<i>Spirula</i>), or some modification of such an apparatus. The
last chamber or cell of these enclosed shells is too small to
admit any part of the body of the animal; a character by
which the fossil species of this Order may be distinguished
from those of the other order. Others have a horny or calcareous
osselet, as the bone of the Cuttle-fish, and pen of the
Calamary or Sea-pen (see <i>Bd.</i> pl. 28); and in an appendage
of this kind a conical chambered shell is contained in many
of the fossil genera, hereafter to be noticed. These animals
have eight arms, with the addition in some genera of two long
tentacula, which are furnished with rows of suctorial disks
or cups, called <i>acetabula</i> (see <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>, <i>figs.</i> 1, 6).</p>

<p>These naked Cephalopoda, devoid of any external defence,
possess a very extraordinary means of escape from their
enemies. They are furnished with a bag or bladder, containing
a dark fluid resembling ink in appearance, which
they have the power of ejecting into the surrounding water
upon the approach of danger; and by the obscurity t us
induced, they foil the pursuit of their adversaries: the
Nautilus and other cephalopods, protected by a large external
shell, are destitute of such an apparatus. The deep
brown colour, <i>sepia</i>, was formerly prepared from the fluid of
the ink-bags of different species of Cuttle-fish; a similar
substance secreted by extinct naked Cephalopoda, as we
shall presently demonstrate, is found in a fossil state. These
preliminary remarks on the organization of the recent animals
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451"> 451 </a></span>
will prepare us for the investigation of the extinct
species. We will first notice those remarkable fossils, called
<i>Belemnites</i>, or thunder-stones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Belemnite</span> (from a supposed resemblance to the head of a
dart or javelin). <i>Lign.</i> <a href="#lign_141">141</a> to <a href="#lign_144">144</a>. Among the innumerable
relics of an earlier world, which swarm in the sedimentary
deposits, there are perhaps no fossil bodies that have excited
more curiosity, and given rise to so many fruitless conjectures
as to their nature and origin, as the Belemnites.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> These are
long, cylindrical, or fusiform fossils, more or less pointed at
one extremity, and having at the other and larger end
a conical cavity, which is either occupied by a chambered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452"> 452 </a></span>
shell, or filled up with the material in which the fossils are
imbedded. Their substance is like fibrous calcareous spar,
varying in colour from a dark brown to a light amber;
many are transparent, others nearly opaque. When broken
transversely they present a radiated structure (<a href="#lign_141"><i>Lign.</i> 141</a>,
<i>fig.</i> 1) and a minute central cavity, or axis, is seen to
extend through the whole length of the solid portion of the
stone (see <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>, <i>fig.</i> 5.). A longitudinal section (<a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>,
 <i>figs.</i> 4 and 5) shows the conical cavity in the upper part,
and that the shaft consists of a series of concentric layers.
Such are the characters of these fossils in the examples of
most frequent occurrence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_402" id="Footnote_402"></a><a href="#FNanchor_402"><span class="label">[402]</span></a> See Park. Org. Rem. vol. iii. p. 122.</p></div>

<p>The Belemnites vary in size from the small, delicate,
transparent species, <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>, <i>figs.</i> 3 and 4, to massy
opaque specimens, several inches in circumference, and from
ten to twenty inches in length. They present also considerable
variety of form; some are regularly cylindrical, as
in <a href="#lign_141"><i>Lign.</i> 141</a> <i>fig.</i> 1; others broad and flattened, as in <i>fig.</i> 4;
or subfusiform, as in <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>, figs. 3 and 4. The small
end is slender and pointed in some belemnites, and in others
is obtuse, or rounded, with a projecting point. In many
there is a longitudinal groove or furrow on the ventral
aspect; and some species have a furrow on each side, as in
that represented in <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2.</p>

<p>But the fossils above described are only a part of the
original structure of the Belemnite. When in a perfect
state, the cavity seen in <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>, <i>fig.</i> 5, is occupied by
a chambered conical shell, called the <i>phragmocone</i>, composed
of a series of shallow concave cells, of a nacreous or pearly
substance, which are pierced by a siphuncle at the margin;
see <a href="#lign_141"><i>Lign.</i> 141</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2.</p>

<p>The invariably radiated crystalline structure of the
Belemnite has evidently resulted from the peculiar organization
of the original osselet, which is formed of thin concentric
lamin&aelig;, of very minute prismatic trihedral fibres,
arranged at right angles to the planes of the successive
layers.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_403" id="Footnote_403"></a><a href="#FNanchor_403"><span class="label">[403]</span></a> The Belemnitic shell presents the same arrangement of its constituent
layers as the Pearl-mussel, Pinna, and other <i>Aviculid&aelig;</i>, viz.
the outer layer is prismatic-cellular, the inner nacreous: the first is
formed by the free margin of the mantle, the second by the visceral
("peritoneal") part of the mantle.&mdash;<i>Mr. Woodward.</i></p></div>

<p>From the obvious analogy of the structure above demonstrated
with that of the recent dibranchiate Cephalopoda,
several eminent naturalists inferred that the animal of the
Belemnite was closely related to the existing types; and the
late Mr. Miller, in a communication to the Geological
Society of London, gave a restored figure of the original,
which, as modified by M. D&#8217;Orbigny, is represented <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>,
 <i>figs.</i> 1 and 6. The indefatigable and successful researches
of the Rev. Dr. Buckland have confirmed the
general correctness of this restoration. In the Lias of
Dorsetshire two specimens of the Belemnite, with its chambered
shell and horny or pearly receptacle, still retaining
the ink-bag and its contents, have been discovered, and were
figured in the Br. Treatise (<i>Bd.</i> pl. 44&#8242;, 44&#8243;). A third
specimen, showing the ink-bag, is in the British Museum.</p>

<p>The ink-bag of the Belemnite is very small, as might be
expected, from the extent to which it is protected by a
chambered shell. The mandibles or beaks of the Belemnite
are supposed to have been horny, as in the other naked
Cephalopoda; since no calcareous beaks have been found
associated with their remains.</p>

<p>"The Belemnite having the advantage of its dense, but
well-balanced internal shell, must have exercised the power
of swimming backwards and forwards, which it possessed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457"> 457 </a></span>
common with the modern decapod (<i>ten-armed</i>) Dibranchiata,
with great vigour and precision. Its position was probably
more commonly vertical than in its recent congeners. It
would rise swiftly and stealthily to infix its claws in the
belly of a supernatant fish, and then perhaps as swiftly dart
down, and drag its prey to the bottom and devour it. We
cannot doubt at least but that, like the hooked Calamaries
of the present seas, the ancient Belemnites were the most
formidable and predacious of their class."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Owen.</span></p>

<p>The Belemnites of the oolitic limestones frequently contain
the phragmocone, either filled with calcareous spar, or
with its cells empty. In the clays the horny sheath or
receptacle is sometimes found pressed flat and extending
above the alveolus of the osselet, and has often a thin coat
of nacre of a pearly lustre, but it is more commonly
detached.</p>

<p>The Belemnites abound in the Lias, Oolite, and Chalk,
and have not been discovered in any other deposits; there
are nearly thirty British species, some of which are restricted
to the Chalk, and others to the Oolite and Lias.</p>

<p>A few characteristic forms are represented, <a href="#lign_141"><i>Lign.</i> 141 and
142</a>, in order to illustrate the three groups which, according
to M. D&#8217;Orbigny, are peculiar to the grand divisions of the
Cretaceous formation.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Belemnitella mucronata.</span> <a href="#lign_141"><i>Lign.</i> 141</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1.&mdash;The
name <i>Belemnitella</i> is given to those Belemnites which have
a slit, or crevice, on the anterior margin of the alveolus or
cavity, and two lateral impressions. The surface is sometimes
granulated, and often has vascular markings, produced
by the investing integument of the living animal. The
form of the aperture is shown in the middle dextral figure;
and the radiated structure, as seen by a transverse section,
in the sketch.</p>

<p>This species is abundant in the <i>White Chalk</i>, particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458"> 458 </a></span>
in certain localities in Norfolk and Devonshire. It is more
frequent in the chalk of Kent than in that of Sussex; and
in the cretaceous strata around Brighton, than in those
near Lewes. I have never been able to detect the least
vestige of the phragmocone, or chambered shell, in the
alveolus. This Belemnite is occasionally imbedded in flint
nodules; and such examples possess the calcareous crystalline
structure of the chalk and limestone specimens. In
the chalk of Ireland, the Belemnites which have been
corroded, or perforated by marine borers (<i>cliona</i>), are often
injected with flint; and if the calcareous substance be
removed by immersion in dilute hydrochloric acid, exquisite
siliceous casts may be obtained (see also page 403). It is
not unusual to find flints with a cavity, occasioned by the
solution and removal of the calcareous guard, and having a
siliceous conical cast of the alveolus, occupying the upper
part of the interspace. The reader will recollect that the
pulley-stones of the Derbyshire Encrinites were produced
by a similar process (see <a href="#Page_285">p. 285</a>, vol. i.).</p>

<p>The American cretaceous sands abound in a species of
Belemnitella, nearly related to <i>B. mucronata</i>.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Belemnites Listeri.</span> <a href="#lign_142"><i>Lign.</i> 142</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3.&mdash;This small
elegant Belemnite has two lateral grooves, and is generally
as transparent as amber; it has frequently a nacreous or
calcareous pellicle partially investing the guard. It seldom
exceeds two inches in length. It is abundant in, and peculiar
to, the <span class="smcap">Galt</span>, or blue marl of the Chalk, and is constantly
associated with the Inocerami, previously described
as common at Folkstone, Bletchingley, Ringmer, and other
localities of that deposit. The Red Chalk of Norfolk
contains the same species (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 589).</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Belemnites dilatatus.</span> <a href="#lign_141"><i>Lign.</i> 141</a>, <i>fig.</i> 4.&mdash;This species
is distinguished by its flattened form, and by the
longitudinal furrow being situated on the margin opposite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459"> 459 </a></span>
to the siphuncle of the phragmocone, instead of being on
the same side, as is most usual. It is supposed by M.
D&#8217;Orbigny to be characteristic of the Neocomian beds, or
lowermost division of the Shanklin Sand.</p>

<p>4. The Chalk-marl contains a Belemnite of a more
elongated form than those above described, the apex gradually
tapering to a point, with a slight double furrow on
each side. It is named <i>B. lanceolatus</i> (<i>Sow. Min. Conch.</i>
tab. 600, figs. 8, 9), and is very common in the marl-pits at
Steyning, Clayton, and Hamsey, in Sussex.</p>

<p>At the base of Golden Cap Hill, near Charmouth, there
are two strata of marl-stone observable on the shore, which are
literally paved with Belemnites. Great numbers of these
fossils have Serpul&aelig; and other extraneous shells attached to
them, a proof that the ink-bags and other soft parts of the
mollusks had decomposed, and that the guards had lain
uncovered at the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>M. De Koninck has discovered in the Devonian limestone
of Belgium, at Couvin and Vis&eacute;, a small fossil body
which closely resembles in form and structure the rostrum
or guard of a belemnite; it is, however, too fragmentary to
admit of positive detemination.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<p>From the extraordinarily perfect condition of the Belemnoteuthis
here figured, which of itself exemplifies the essential
parts of its structure, a brief description will suffice.
The body is of an elongated form, with a pair of lateral fins,
two large sessile eyes, eight uncinated arms, and a pair of
armed tentacles; each arm was furnished with from twenty
to forty pairs of hooks, placed alternately. Like the Sepia
it had a pigmental sac or ink-bag, which is generally found
filled with the inspissated secretion. The inferior part of
the body is of a conical form, and contains a brown horny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462"> 462 </a></span>
osselet, with a siphunculated phragmocone, that terminates
in a guard or rostrum of a fibrous structure.</p>

<p>[In the recent genus <i>Onychoteuthis</i>, the tentacles alone are
armed with claws; <i>Enoploteuthis</i> has claws both on the
arms and on the tentacles, but the latter are long and feeble,
and the hooks are confined to their extremities. The extinct
<i>Belemnoteuthis</i> (like the <i>Acanthoteuthis</i> of Solenhofen, <i>Lign.</i>
140) had eight nearly equal arms, the dorsal pair being
rather smaller than the rest; each arm was furnished with
twenty to forty pairs of hooks, forming a double, alternating
row. The tentacles were not longer than the arms, and
like them had a double series of hooks extending from their
bases to the points. In all essential points of structure, the
Belemnoteuthis is most nearly related to the Calamaries
(<i>Teuthid&aelig;</i>), but, in consequence of the prolongation of its
pointed shell posteriorly, the fins become lateral (as in
<i>Sepiola</i> and <i>Sepia</i>), instead of terminal. Whilst the complicated
(chambered) structure of its shell, and the peculiar
character of the <i>tentacles</i>, show that it must be regarded as
a type distinct from and equal in importance to the Calamaries.
It cannot be doubted that the <i>Belemnite</i> and <i>Conoteuthis</i>
present similar conditions of the soft parts; and the
four genera will form the Family <span class="smcap">Belemnitid&aelig;</span>. The normal
position of these animals in the sea is horizontal,
whilst that of the Nautiloid genera must have been vertical,
with the head downwards.&mdash;<i>Mr. Woodward.</i>]</p>

<p>The fossils which have afforded this unexpected and highly
interesting illustration of the nature of the extinct animals
of this Order have been obtained by closely examining the
shales in which they abound, and, before removing the solid
osselet, carefully searching the surrounding stone for traces
of the more perishable parts. The attention of the collector
can scarcely be too often directed to the necessity of examining
the surrounding matrix before extricating a fossil
from its bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beloptera.</span> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xliv. <i>fig.</i> 15. <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 591.)&mdash;Under
this name Mr. Sowerby figures and describes a very
curious fossil, from the London Clay at Highgate, which
seems to hold an intermediate place between the Cuttle-fish
and the Spirulirostra. The guard, which is of an oblong
form, with an obtuse apex, has the structure of the osselet
of the Sepia, and contains in its upper part a phragmocone,
the cells of which are very narrow. In strata of the same
age, in France, three species have been discovered by M.
Deshayes. I allude to these shells, that the attention of the
collector may be directed to the search after other examples
in our tertiary deposits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Calamary, or Squid. Geoteuthis.</span><a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxviii.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464"> 464 </a></span>
xxix.)&mdash;The common Calamary (<i>Loligo vulgaris</i>) is so often
seen on our shores, that its general aspect must be familiar
to all who frequent the sea-side. In this animal, the osselet,
or internal support, is a cartilaginous elongated body, which,
from its form, is called Sea-pen (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxviii.); and even this
delicate structure is found in a fossil state. In the Lias of
Lyme Regis, Miss Mary Aiming first discovered specimens
of <i>Sea-pens</i> in juxtaposition with the ink-bag, as in the
recent Calamary; and subsequently many similar examples
have been found, both in England and on the Continent.
Dr. Buckland has given some exquisite figures of these fossils;
and his collection contains a matchless series of these
most interesting organic remains. In some specimens the
ink-bag and its tube or duct, but little compressed, are
occasionally met with, having a brilliant nacreous pellicle,
the remains of the sheath, attached to the surface. The
ink-bag is sometimes of considerable magnitude; specimens
have been found at Lyme Regis nearly a foot in length.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
The circumstance of the ink-bags being generally full of
sepia admits of the inference (as Dr. Buckland with his
wonted acumen remarks), that these individuals died suddenly;
for their living analogues reject the inky fluid upon
the least approach of danger. The perfect condition of the
bag proves also their instantaneous enclosure in the deposit,
for the distended membrane would otherwise have burst from
decomposition, and the contents would have escaped. The
fossil marine reptiles, the Ichthyosauri, &amp;c., with which these
fossils are associated, present similar phenomena, as we shall
hereafter have occasion to remark, and strengthen the probability,
that swarms of the inhabitants of the Liassic ocean
were suddenly destroyed, and imbedded, on the area now
occupied by their remains.</p>

by the late Count M&uuml;nster, which exhibits an imprint of
the body, the arms and tentacles being represented by
ten double rows of horny hooks, which precisely resemble
those of Belemnoteuthis. M. D&#8217;Orbigny supposes that the

<p><span class="smcap">Bellerophon.</span>&mdash;It has been already stated, that the animals
of one genus of the existing dibranchiate Cephalopoda
are protected by a thin, flexible, symmetrical, keeled shell,
convoluted on a vertical plane, and having but one chamber&mdash;this
is the <i>Argonaut</i>, or <i>Paper Nautilus</i>, an inhabitant of the
Mediterranean. This animal belongs to the Octopoda, or those
which have eight arms; and in one pair of these processes
the extremities expand into broad and thin membranes, by
which the delicate, elastic, calcareous envelopement, or shell,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466"> 466 </a></span>
is secreted. There membranes usually encompass the shell,
and meet and overlap each other along its keel; and by
them chiefly the shell is retained in its position. When
these membranes are withdrawn, or the animal dies, the
shell, having no muscular connexion with the soft parts,
readily separates from the body. Hence the doubts so long
entertained as to the relation between the animal of the
Argonaut and its shell, but which are now set at rest; the
observations on the living animal by Madame Tower, and
the anatomical demonstrations by M. Sander Rang, having
removed the obscurity in which the subject was formerly
involved.</p>

<p>In the Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous deposits
there are several species of a genus of shells, the animals of
which are by some considered to have been analogous to the
recent Argonaut. It is named Bellerophon. I have figured
two species; one from the Mountain Limestone, <a href="#lign_148"><i>Lign.</i> 148</a>,
<i>fig.</i> 1; the other from the Silurian System. There are about
thirty British species, most of which are of small size; some
of them are keeled, others have a slight dorsal depression,
as in <i>fig.</i> 1. and many have the back rounded, and the sides
lobed, as in <a href="#lign_148"><i>Lign.</i> 148</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2.</p>

different, as we have already explained (see <a href="#Page_369">p. 369</a>).

<p>The appearance and structure of the recent shell are
familiar to every one; a correct knowledge of the nature of
the original animal has, however, been obtained but very
recently. In its general
characters the animal of the
Nautilus, which is an inhabitant
of the seas of hot climates,
resembles the naked
Cephalopoda; it possesses
four <i>branchi&aelig;</i>, or gills, and
numerous hollow arms and
retractile tentacula. Its
head is furnished with a
muscular flattened disk,
which serves as an operculum
to the shell when the
animal is retracted. The
beaks are horny, and coated
at their tips by calcareous
matter. It has no ink-bag,
and is destitute of fins or
other organs for swimming. The body occupies the ample
outer cell of the shell, to which it is firmly attached
by two lateral muscles; and it has a siphuncle, that passes
from the posterior part of the animal through the shelly
tube, and by which communication is maintained with the
entire series of cells or chambers. The siphuncle is provided
with a small artery and vein, and traverses the entire
series of chambers, thus maintaining the vitality of the shell.
Mr. Edwards considers that "it may be looked upon as an
elongated c&aelig;cum, and that it is not under any circumstances
used by the animal as a hydrostatic balance."<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_409" id="Footnote_409"></a><a href="#FNanchor_409"><span class="label">[409]</span></a> The reader interested in this subject should consult the <i>Memoirs</i>
by M. Valenciennes, Mem. de l&#8217;Inst.; M. Vander Hoven, in the Proceedings
of the Zoological Society; Prof. Owen&#8217;s <i>Memoir on the
Pearly Nautilus</i>, Mr. Gray&#8217;s paper in the An. Nat. Hist., Mr. Edward&#8217;s

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468"> 468 </a></span></p></div>

<p>Upon making a vertical section of the shell, the inner
volutions are exposed, and the cavity is seen divided at
regular intervals into cells, by smooth, concave, nacreous
septa; these vary in number according to the age of the
individual; there are about thirty-five in an adult specimen.
The partitions are pierced in the <i>centre</i> by a shelly
tube, which traverses each cell to within a short distance of
the next partition; and this tube is rendered a continuous
channel in the living animal, by the membranous siphuncle.
This series of air-chambers constitutes an apparatus which
renders the Nautilus nearly of the same specific gravity as
the surrounding water, and enables it to rise to the surface
of the sea, or sink to the bottom, by a very small amount
of muscular exertion. The Nautilus swims, like the Cuttle-fish,
by expelling the water from its respiratory chamber;
the walls of which are very thick and powerful muscles.</p>

<p>From this very general description of the only living representative
of the numerous genera of tetrabranchiate
Cephalopoda, which swarmed in such prodigious numbers
in the ancient seas, we may pass to the consideration of the
fossil Nautili, and their related congeners. Our remarks
must be limited to the genera that will serve to demonstrate
the most important modifications of structure, and explain
the nature of the fossil remains of this extensive class of
extinct beings.</p>

<p>The genera into which these shells are distributed are
founded upon the mode in which the shell is coiled, its
form, the character of the partitions or septa, and the
situation of the siphuncle. A little reflection will enable
the student to understand the principles of this classification.
The essential character of all the shells of this class, is to have
an external chamber larger than the inner chambers, and
which contains the body of the animal; to be divided internally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469"> 469 </a></span>
into different compartments, by partitions (concavo-convex,
with the concavity outwards); and to have a pipe or
tube extending from the outer open chamber to the innermost
cell. They are divided into three groups or families.</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Nautilid&aelig;</span> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxxi.): in these the septa are
smooth, or but slightly undulated, and the siphuncle either
traverses the centre of the cell-partitions, or is situated
towards the inner margin or turn of the spire.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Orthoceratid&aelig;</span> (<a href="#lign_155"><i>Lign.</i> 155</a>): in these the siphuncle
is complicated in its structure; it is central or
lateral; the septa are smooth. (<i>Woodward&#8217;s Man. Moll.</i>
p. 87.)</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Ammonitid&aelig;</span> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxxv-xlii.): in these the
septa are more or less waved, and their margins foliated or
crenated, that is, indented; and the siphuncle is situated
at or near the outer margin.</p>

<p>In the Nautilus, the shell is convoluted on the same
plane, in spiral whorls, all of which are contiguous, and the
siphuncle is central.</p>

<p>The British strata contain about sixty species of Nautili.
The Tertiary formations have yielded five or six; the Cretaceous
a like number; the Lias and Oolite ten or eleven;
the Carboniferous about thirty species; and the Devonian
two species. In the London Clay a large and beautiful
species is abundant (<i>Nautilus imperialis.</i> <i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. i.),
having the shell very commonly entire; but the outer
opaque coat frequently flakes off, and exposes the pearly or
nacreous internal layer. The septa generally retain their
original nacreous structure, and the cells are either occupied
by clay or marl, or are partially filled or lined with calcareous
spar, brilliant pyrites, or other mineral matter. These
Nautili are often found constituting the nuclei of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470"> 470 </a></span>
<i>septaria</i>, or clay nodules, with which this deposit abounds.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a>
The small species, <i>N. centralis</i> (<i>Ly.</i> <i>fig.</i> 179), and <i>Nautilus</i>
(<i>Aturia</i>) <i>ziczac</i> (<i>Wond.</i> p. 247), occur in the same strata.
The London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey and of the coasts
of Hants and Sussex is productive of these fossils.</p>

<i>Lower Chalk.</i> <i>Lewes.</i> (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> <i>nat. size</i>.)</div>
</div>

<p>In the White Chalk near Lewes, casts of several very
large Nautili have been found; but shells of this genus are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471"> 471 </a></span>
more abundant in the lower division, the <i>Chalk-marl</i>. A
large and beautiful species, <i>Nautilus elegans</i> (<i>Min. Conch.</i>
tab. 116), is not unusual in the marl-pits near Lewes, Clayton,
Steyning, &amp;c. and may be considered as characteristic
of that portion of the Cretaceous deposits. The first specimen
discovered (<i>Foss. South D.</i> tab. xx) was from the marl-bank
immediately at the foot of the mound on which stands
the church of <span class="smcap">Hamsey</span>, a little hamlet on the north of
Lewes; a spot from which I obtained numerous other
cephalopodous shells, at that time unknown as British
species. The collocation of fossils at Hamsey is similar to
that observable in the quarries at St. Catherine&#8217;s Mount,
near Rouen. These remains only occur as casts, no vestige
of the shell remaining; but sections will sometimes show
the situation of the siphon, its tube being filled with a different
material from that which occupies the cells. This is
exemplified in the section of a smaller species (<i>N. pseudo-elegans</i>,
<a href="#lign_150"><i>Lign.</i> 150</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2), in which the channel of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472"> 472 </a></span>
siphon is filled with a dark-coloured marl, <i>a</i>; the lines
formed by the section of the smooth septa are also shown.
In the same lignograph, <i>fig.</i> 3, a front view and profile of
another chalk-marl Nautilite are figured.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a></p>

<p>In the Chalk, as well as in many other calcareous deposits,
the shells of the Nautili, Ammonites, &amp;c. are very
rarely preserved; even the internal septa are often dissolved,
and the stony casts, moulded in the cells, remain

be obtained (in the Coralline Oolite); forming, as it

to the Nautilid&aelig;, and is peculiar to the Devonian deposits.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474"> 474 </a></span>
It differs from the allied genera in the siphuncle being
situated on the inner margin of the septa. The shell is
discoidal, and the septa are very slightly lobed. At Elbersreuth,
near Bareuth, in the N. E. of Bavaria, the Devonian
strata abound in these shells; thirty-five species have been
found, the greater number being peculiar to that locality.</p>

<p>In England they are chiefly found at South Petherwin,
Cornwall, and in the Devonshire marbles. (<i>See Phillip&#8217;s
Pal. Foss. Devonshire.</i>)</p>


<div class="sidenote">ORTHOCERAS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Orthoceras</span> (straight shell), <a href="#lign_155"><i>Lign.</i> 155</a>.&mdash;The shells of
this genus may be described as Nautili uncoiled and extended
in a straight line. They are straight, elongated,
chambered shells, with smooth and gently undulated septa,
which are concave towards the opening or upper part, and
have the siphuncle either central, or not far removed from
the centre. The <i>Orthoceratites</i> more especially belong to
the ancient Secondary strata. They first appear in the
Silurian, and abound in the Devonian and Carboniferous.
They vary in size from a few inches to several feet in length,
and eight or nine inches in diameter; and in form, from a
slender elongated cone, to a short, massy, almost spherical
figure, with a contracted orifice. Some examples have been
noticed with upwards of sixty cells. Mr. Sowerby figures
and describes <i>O. giganteum</i> (<i>Min. Conch.</i> tab. 246), from
Scotland, as exceeding seven or eight feet in length; and I
discovered on the beach at Brighton, where it had probably
been brought by some vessel, among ballast, a fine fragment
of the same species, indicating as great a magnitude.
Several species are figured, <a href="#lign_155"><i>Lign.</i> 155</a>, to show the structure
and appearance of these fossils. The casts of the separate
cells are often found. The section, <i>fig.</i> 3, from the red
marble of Devonshire, beautifully displays the situation of
the siphuncle, and the lines of the septa. The shelly siphuncle,
which is moniliform (<i>bead-like</i>), or dilated at each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475"> 475 </a></span>
chamber, is replaced by white spar; and the membranous
internal tube is filled with a dark substance, probably
molluskite.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477"> 477 </a></span>
on the heads of Jupiter Ammon), are among the most common
and well-known fossils of the British secondary strata.
In some districts, as in Yorkshire
and Somersetshire, where
the Ammonites abundantly prevail,
they were noticed in very
remote times. Local legends,
ascribing their origin to swarms
of snakes turned into stone by
the prayers of some patron
saint, are still extant, and are
perpetuated by the name of
snake-stones, by which these
fossils are provincially known.
The Lias, near Whitby, in Yorkshire,
contains immense numbers
of two or three species,
one of which (<i>Am. bifrons</i>) is

<p>The shells comprehended in this family are either spiral,
involute, arched, or straight; their septa are deeply lobed,
and have the margins foliated. The siphuncle is dorsal, as
shown by the notch in the cast, <a href="#lign_156"><i>Lign.</i> 156</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3<i>a</i>. Several
hundred species have been described; they are divided into
genera which are characterized by essential modifications in
the direction of the spire, and the inflections of the septa.
Thus, in the <i>Ammonites</i>, <a href="#lign_156"><i>Lign.</i> 156</a>, the spire is involute,
and all the turns contiguous; in <i>Crioceras</i> (<i>curved-horn</i>),
<a href="#lign_160"><i>Lign.</i> 160</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2, evolute; in <i>Scaphites</i>, incurved at both

of structure which appear to be too important for specific

<div class="sidenote">AMMONITE.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ammonites.</span> <a href="#lign_156"><i>Lign.</i> 156</a>, 157, 158.&mdash;Shell discoidal, more
or less compressed, whorls of the spire contiguous, and often
visible; septa lobed, their margins deeply sinuated; aperture
symmetrical, border or lip thickened, often notched and
auriculated. Siphuncle dorsal.</p>

<p>The student will be able readily to distinguish Ammonites
from Nautili by attention to the above definition. The
situation of the siphuncle, the foliated or wrinkled edges of
the septa, as shown in the cast, <a href="#lign_156"><i>Lign.</i> 156</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2; and when
these characters are wanting, the arched ribs and elevations,
as in <i>figs.</i> 1 and 3, will serve as discriminating features.
Like the fossil Nautili, the Ammonites most commonly
occur as casts, the shell having been dissolved. Sometimes
these consist of semi-transparent calcareous spar, the cast of
each cell being distinct, but held together by the interlocking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479"> 479 </a></span>
of the foliations of the septa; such examples are of
great beauty and interest (see <i>Bd.</i> pl. xlii. figs. 2, 3); they
most frequently occur in the limestones of the Oolite. The
siphuncle is often preserved, even in the chalk specimens,
in which all traces of the shell are lost. In a large Ammonite
from, near Lewes, not only the shelly siphuncle remains,
but even the internal membranous tube, converted into
dark molluskite. Separate portions of similar siphuncles
occur in the chalk, and have been mistaken for tubular
shells.</p>

of the aperture
</div>
</div>

<p>The outer lip, or margin of the aperture, is occasionally
found entire. In some species there is a dorsal process, as
in a very common Chalk Ammonite
(<i>A. varians</i>, <a href="#lign_156"><i>Lign.</i> 156</a>,
<i>fig.</i> 1), which extends far beyond
the margin; in other
species, from the Oxford Clay,
there are long, narrow, lateral
appendages, (<a href="#lign_158"><i>Lign.</i> 158</a>). In
the collection of S. P. Pratt,
Esq., there is a small Ammonite,
from the Inferior Oolite
of Normandy, in which these
processes meet over the aperture,
leaving only a circular aperture towards the back of
the shell (where the siphuncle of the animal would be
situated) and a narrow fissure on the side next the involute
spire. The specimen is unique, and can scarcely be regarded
as a normal form.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> (Mr. Woodward.)</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_414" id="Footnote_414"></a><a href="#FNanchor_414"><span class="label">[414]</span></a> M. Steenstrup has described a species of <i>Purpura</i>, which at the
close of its life shuts up the aperture of its shell, with the exception
of the respiratory siphon.&mdash;<i>Mr. Woodward.</i></p></div>

<p>From the small size of the cells of the Ammonites, particularly
in those species which are of a depressed or flattened
form, it was long doubted whether the outer chamber could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480"> 480 </a></span>
have been sufficiently capacious to contain the body of the
animal; and it was supposed that these shells were internal,
like the recent <i>Spirula</i>, or <i>Crosier</i>. But Dr. Buckland has
clearly demonstrated, that the outer cell of the Ammonite,
if restricted in breadth, is sufficiently ample in length to
have contained the soft parts of a Cephalopod, equal in
magnitude to the largest known specimens, its proportion to
the chambered part being as considerable as in the Nautilus.
The outer chamber often occupies more than half, and in
some instances the entire circumference of the outer whorl
(see <i>Bd.</i> pl. xxxvi.).</p>

<p>In certain argillaceous deposits, as the Galt, and the clays
of the Lias, Ammonites with the shell preserved are abundant;
generally the outer opaque layer is wanting, or
adheres to the matrix when a specimen is removed, leaving
only the internal nacreous, or pearly coat. Folkstone, on
the coast of Kent, is celebrated for examples of this kind,
which may easily be collected from the Galt, which forms
the base of the cliffs, at Eastware Bay. Watchett, in Somersetshire,
is equally rich in the pearly Ammonites of the
Lias; entire layers of these beautiful organic remains occur
in the limestones and in the shale exposed at low water.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_415" id="Footnote_415"></a><a href="#FNanchor_415"><span class="label">[415]</span></a> A splendid group of these Ammonites may be seen in the Gallery
of Fossils at the British Museum.</p></div>

<p>The shell of the Ammonite is generally thinner and more
delicate than that of the Nautilus. However thin these
shells may be, they are possessed of great strength of structure.
Not only is the shell one continuous <i>arch</i>, but it is
moreover provided with transverse arches or corrugated <i>ribs</i>,
which, like the flutings on metal pencil-cases, and <i>corrugated
sheet-iron</i>, greatly strengthen the thin material. These ribs
are further subdivided, so as to multiply supports as the
convexity of the shell enlarges, in a manner somewhat
similar to the <i>groin-work</i> of vaulted roofs. The spines,
tubercles, and bosses, which often arise from the ribs, are so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481"> 481 </a></span>
many additions to the strength of the latter. The sides of
the shell are also supported by the transverse plates forming
the <i>septa</i>, or divisions of the chambers, and, as these plates
are very sinuous where they meet the sides of the shell, they
distribute their support over a considerable portion of the
surface.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> These complicated edges of the <i>septa</i> form the
delicate and intricate lines of foliation (<i>sutures</i>) seen on the
casts of Ammonites (<a href="#lign_156"><i>Lign.</i> 156</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2), Baculites (<a href="#lign_161"><i>Lign.</i> 161</a>,
 <i>fig.</i> 3), Hamites, &amp;c. In some species the shell is thick
and dense, as in the Ammonites of the Kimmeridge Clay
near Aylesbury, in which one species (<i>Ammonites biplex</i>,
<i>Min. Conch.</i> pl. ccxciii.) in particular abounds, and is very
generally invested with the shell, as perfect as if recent.
The same Ammonite occurs in the Portland limestone above,
in the state of casts, without any vestige of the shell. In
some strata the shell is replaced by calcareous spar; in
others by silex or flint.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> In the pyritous clays and shales
of the Lias, the shell and all its delicate internal mechanism
are coated with or replaced by brilliant sulphuret of iron,
forming the most exquisite natural electrotype imaginable.
Polished vertical sections of these fossils often exhibit the
inner cells filled with transparent white calcareous spar;
sometimes with groups of crystals of sulphate of lime. The
Ammonites of the Galt, and of the Kimmeridge Clay, are
also frequently imbued with the same mineral.</p>

<p>There are about two hundred identified species of Ammonite
in the British strata, ranging through all the secondary
formations; they have not been found in the Tertiary
deposits. They vary in size from half an inch to four feet
in diameter.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

Head, which indicated even larger proportions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482"> 482 </a></span></p></div>

<p>Certain species are restricted to particular formations,
and are therefore oftentimes of essential aid in determining
the relations of a deposit; for example, the <i>Galt</i> contains
several species not found in the upper division of the Chalk;
and in the Chalk-maid are species that have not been discovered
in other strata. Certain Ammonites of the Lias are
peculiar to that formation (as <i>A. Walcottii</i>, <a href="#lign_127"><i>Lign.</i> 127</a>, <i>fig.</i> 7,
p. 397; and <i>A. communis</i>, <a href="#lign_157"><i>Lign.</i> 157</a>). Ammonites of
species allied to those of our Middle and Lower Oolites have
been discovered in strata in the Himalaya mountains, several
thousand feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goniatites</span>, <a href="#lign_159"><i>Lign.</i> 159</a>.&mdash;From the numerous family of
Ammonites, a separation has been made of a large division,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483"> 483 </a></span>
in which the margins of the septa are not deeply notched or
foliated, and are destitute of lateral crenatures or denticulations,
so that their outline always presents a continued
uninterrupted line. The siphuncle is relatively small. The
last or outer cell of the shell extends beyond one turn of
the chambered part. The back is occasionally keeled, but
in most species is round. In illustration of this genus,
which is named <i>Goniatites</i>, I have selected two common
species (<a href="#lign_159"><i>Lign.</i> 159</a>) from the Carboniferous limestone, and
annexed outlines of a suture (the edge of the septum) of a
Goniatite, and of an Ammonite, for comparison. The importance
of the separation of this type of Ammonites into a
distinct genus, relates to the Goniatites being restricted to
some of the older sedimentary strata; for although there
are sixty British species, none of them have been observed
above the Carboniferous system.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

inches in length. It is figured and described, by the name
of <i>Scaphites Hillsii</i>, in the admirable Memoir of Dr. Fitton
on the Strata below the Chalk (<i>Geol. Trans.</i> vol. iv. pl. xv.);
the present genus was not then established. The Shanklin

<p>In my early researches in the Chalk-marl of Hamsey, I
discovered numerous solid, oval, and cylindrical pipes of
marl, with scarcely any vestige of organic structure, whose
origin it was impossible to determine. At length I found
the specimen, <a href="#lign_161"><i>Lign.</i> 161</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2, which showed the perfect
aperture of a chambered shell; and afterwards I found portions
which displayed the foliated septa. (<i>Foss. South D.</i> tab.
xxiii. <i>figs.</i> 5, 6, 7.) The Baculite, when perfect, is elongated
to a point; the septa are very numerous and foliated; the
siphuncle is situated on the margin. I have a splendid
specimen from the Chalk of France, (collected by <i>M. Alex.
Brongniart</i>,) which is composed of distinct casts of the cells,
held together by the deep inflections of their margins, in
the same manner as are the sparry casts of Ammonites,

Sand, of a boat-like form, with the inner whorls coiled up in
a spire, and half hidden by the outer chamber, which
becomes contracted and recurved on itself, is destitute of
septa, and terminates in an oval or transverse mouth. The
siphuncle is dorsal. An <i>Ancyloceras</i> closely coiled would be
a Scaphite. Hamsey marl-pit yielded to my early researches
the first Scaphites discovered in the British strata, together
with Turrilites, and other cephalopodous shells, previously
unknown in England.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> The Scaphite is of an elliptical

form, the spire and the mouth approaching close to each
other; the spire occupies about one-half of the shell.
Except the thick outer lip or margin of the aperture, which
is almost constantly found changed into pyrites, it is rarely
that any vestige of the shell remains. The same mineral
constitutes casts of the spiral part; and these, when separated
from the other portion, might be taken for Ammonites;

<p>The discovery of three species of these elegant shells
rewarded my researches in the little marl-pit at Hamsey,
already noticed, and were the first examples of the genus
found in England.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Like the Ammonites, Scaphites, Hamites,
&amp;c. with which they are associated, the <span class="smcap">Turrilites</span> of
our Chalk-marl seldom possess any traces of their shells.
The specimens are solid and tolerably sharp casts, with occasional
indications of the septa, and more rarely of the
siphunculus. They vary in size from two or three inches to
two feet in length; and are frequently more or less elliptical,
from compression. The three species which generally occur
in the Sussex and Kentish chalk, are <i>T. costatus</i>, <a href="#lign_163"><i>Lign.</i> 163</a>,
<i>fig.</i> 2; <i>T. tuberculatus</i> (<i>Foss. South D.</i> pl. xxiv. <i>fig.</i> 7),
characterised by its four rows of tubercles; and <i>T. undulatus</i>
(<i>Foss. South D.</i> pl. xxiv. <i>fig.</i> 8), the wreaths of which are
ornamented with plain, slightly undulated, transverse ribs.
These are all reversed, or <i>sinistral</i> shells; that is, the spire
is twisted to the left, the aperture being on the right hand
of the observer when the shell is placed on its apex, as in
<i>fig.</i> 1. Several other species of Turrilites occur in the Chalk

with the remains of Ammonites in several localities,
are found flattened triangular bodies, from less than an
inch to an inch and a half in diameter, the nature of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492"> 492 </a></span>
is still somewhat problematical. A good figure is given by
Mr. Parkinson of one species (<i>Org. Rem.</i> vol. iii. pl. xiii. figs.
9, 10, 12. See <i>Pict. Atlas</i>), with the name <i>Trigonellites latus</i>.
These bodies frequently occur in pairs and in apposition, as
in the specimen figured in
<a href="#lign_165"><i>Lign.</i> 165</a>. Their structure
is cellular; one surface is
slightly concave and striated,
and the other covered with
minute circular pores. Altogether
their appearance is
that of bodies enclosed in
vascular integuments. It is
supposed that they are the
opercula of Ammonites.
These fossils are commonly
found in the last or body
chamber of Ammonites, in the Oxford Clay, near Chippenham,
the Coral Oolite of Malton, the Lias of Lyme
Regis, and the lithographic limestone of Solenhofen. M.
Ewald states that they may be found in the Chalk <i>Scaphites</i>
by making a longitudinal section of the body chamber: but
I have not succeeded in detecting them in the examples
from the chalk-marl which I have broken up for that purpose.
As these bodies (alluded to by authors as <i>Trigonellites</i>,
<i>Aptychus</i>, <i>Munsteria</i>, &amp;c.) will probably come under the observation
of the collector, especially among the fossils of the
Kimmeridge Clay, these remarks are introduced to suggest
diligent research, in the hope that the origin of these fossils
may at length be discovered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISTRIBUTION OF FOSSIL CEPHALOPODA.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Distribution of Fossil Cephalopoda.</span>&mdash;Even
from this short review of the principal types of the
fossil Cephalopoda, the great interest which attaches to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493"> 493 </a></span>
study of this class of organic remains is strikingly demonstrated.
Their geological distribution is alike replete with phenomena
of an important character. In the Lower Pal&aelig;ozoic
(Lower and Upper Silurian) strata, the chambered mollusks
belong (with a very few doubtful exceptions) to the Nautilid&aelig;,
namely, Nautilus, Lituites, Cyrtoceras, Orthoceras, &amp;c.
The Devonian and Carboniferous systems contain Nautilus,
Clymenia, Gyroceras, Cyrtoceras, and Orthoceras, together
with a peculiar group of Ammonitid&aelig;, the <i>Goniatites</i>. The
Trias in general is extremely poor in Cephalopoda; the Permian
group affording but two species of Nautilus, and the
Muschelkalk two other species: but, in addition to these,
the Muschelkalk contains Ceratites, which is a genus peculiar
to the Triassic group, and chiefly abounds in the St.
Cassian beds (in the Austrian Alps), where it is accompanied
by Nautilus, Orthoceras, Ammonites, and Goniatites.
In the Lias and Oolite Nautili abound, and we meet for the
first time with Belemnites. The same families, viz. Nautilid&aelig;,
Ammonitid&aelig;, and Belemnitid&aelig;, prevail throughout the Cretaceous
strata. The Tertiary formations contain a few
Nautilid&aelig; only; no vestiges of the Ammonitid&aelig; and true
Belemnitid&aelig;, which, as we have seen, swarmed in the ancient
seas, are perceptible, while in the existing oceans, the <i>Nautilus</i>
and <i>Spirula</i> are the sole representatives of the numerous
shell-bearing cephalopoda of the ancient geological eras.
Thus, the Nautilid&aelig; extend from the oldest to the newest
fossiliferous strata, the genus being still in existence: the
Ammonitid&aelig;, on the other hand, though less ancient in
origin, do not pass beyond the limits of the cretaceous
epoch.</p>

<p>With regard to the zoological affinities between the living
and extinct species of testaceous Cephalopoda, Dr. Buckland
remarks, "that they are all connected by one plan of organization;
each forming a link in the common chain which
unites the existing species with those that prevailed among
the earliest conditions of life upon our globe; and all
attesting the identity of the design that has effected so many
similar ends, through such a variety of instruments, the
principle of whose construction is, in every species, fundamentally
the same.</p>

<p>"Throughout the various living and extinct genera of
these beings, the use of the air-chambers and siphuncle of
their shells, to adjust the specific gravity of the animals in
rising and sinking, appears to have been identical. The addition
of a new transverse plate within the coiled shell added
a new air-chamber, larger than the preceding one, to counterbalance
the increase of weight that attended the growth
of the shell and body of these animals." (<i>Bd.</i> p. 380.)</p>

<p>The occurrence of the Nautilus, and its congeners, among
the earliest traces of the animal kingdom, and their continuance
throughout the immense periods during which the
family of Ammonitid&aelig; was created, flourished, and became
extinct, and the existence of species of the same genus at
the present time, are facts too remarkable to have escaped
the notice even of those who are not professed cultivators of
geological science; and I am induced to quote the following
beautiful lines, by Mrs. Howitt, to impress this interesting
phenomenon more strongly on the mind of the youthful
reader.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_428" id="Footnote_428"></a><a href="#FNanchor_428"><span class="label">[428]</span></a> The poetess has, however, not been literally accurate regarding
the Nautilus and its habits, nor as to the formation of stratified
rocks, but has given a romantic rather than a scientifically correct
view of this interesting Cephalopod, and of the disappearance of
its congener. The young reader must, therefore, remember that the
Nautilus sometimes <i>floats</i>, but <i>never sails</i>; and that the whole race
of Ammonites <i>died out</i> in course of time, and were not annihilated
by convulsive movements of earth and sea.</p>

These are generally in a good state of preservation,
and only require the careful removal of the surrounding
clay or marl. When pyrites largely enters into the composition
of the specimens, the investing matrix can seldom be

state. The <i>Nautilus imperialis</i> is occasionally imbedded in
the septaria of the Isle of Sheppey, and of Bognor and
Bracklesham, on the Sussex coast. Sections of such examples,
in the vertical direction of the enclosed shell, afford,
when polished, very brilliant and interesting fossils; the
septa and the shelly tube of the siphunculus are often
preserved.</p>

<p>The Cephalopods of the Cretaceous formation, with the
exception of those in the argillaceous strata of the Galt, are
generally destitute of their shells, and only occur in the
state of casts; and the Chalk Nautili are liable to separate
at the divisions of the septa, and an entire series of the casts
of the chambers may sometimes be obtained, so as to display
the entire form of the original shell. The Ammonites of
the White Chalk, although mere casts, yet retain their configuration,
the foliated margins of the septa dove-tailing
them together. I have already mentioned that search
should be made along the back of these specimens for the
siphuncle, the shelly tube of which is sometimes well defined.
In the Chalk-marl the casts are sharper than in the
White Chalk, and generally of a deep ochreous colour, with
the lines of the sinuous septa clearly defined. The siphuncle
is occasionally preserved in pyrites, in the Ammonites, Nautili,
Turrilites, and Scaphites; and the outer lip or margin
of the mouth, or aperture, of the latter, and of the Ammonites,
is frequently replaced by the same mineral.</p>

<p>The Ammonites, Hamites, &amp;c. of the Galt have their
pearly coat remaining, but this investment is extremely
delicate; and although when first removed from the marl
it is beautifully iridescent, the vivid hues are very evanescent,
and the shell becomes opaque and of a light fawn
colour. Very commonly the shell flakes off, wholly or in
part, leaving a cast of indurated pyritous marl. I have
preserved specimens with the shell many years, by applying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498"> 498 </a></span>
a thin coat of mastic varnish with a soft camel-hair pencil,
before the marl had become dry, and while the shells were
entire. The Galt Ammonites, like the Nautili of the London
Clay, are often invested with pyrites, and have the
inner cells and siphuncle well preserved.</p>

<p>The argillaceous strata of the Oolite and Lias contain
Ammonites, &amp;c. in much the same state of mineralization
as those of the Galt. The Kimmeridge Clay, in some
localities, particularly around Aylesbury (and especially at
Hartwell Park, the seat of Dr. Lee), abounds in Ammonites
with the shell as perfect and beautiful as if just dredged up
from the sea. But, like the fossils of the Galt, few of the
specimens are durable; although in many examples the
shell may be preserved by the application of mastic varnish.
The most common Ammonite at Hartwell is <i>A. biplex</i> (<i>Sow.
Min. Conch.</i>), which varies from three inches to one foot in
diameter; the surface is covered by very strong ribs that
encircle the whorls. The shell is thick, and composed of
several lamin&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_429" id="Footnote_429"></a><a href="#FNanchor_429"><span class="label">[429]</span></a> According to the observations of my son, the outer layers, when
highly magnified, present an appearance of opaque areol&aelig;, with irregular
radiating fibres; the inner lamin&aelig; are covered with minute
pores, apparently the orifices of tubuli, some of which are arranged
singly in crescents, and others are confluent, like short strands of
beads. I mention the fact to direct attention to the microscopic
examination of the structure of these splendid fossils.</p></div>

<p>The sparry casts of the separate cells of Ammonites which
occur in some of the calcareous beds of the Oolite, will not
fail to be observed by the collector. It is convenient to
preserve such specimens either on a tray or board, in which
a groove is made for their reception, or in a mould of
gutta percha.</p>

<p>In collecting <i>Belemnitid&aelig;</i>, the caution already given, of
examining the surrounding clay or marl, must not be disregarded;
the student should remember, that traces of the soft
parts of the animals, even of mere impressions of the body and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499"> 499 </a></span>
head, with the tentacula and their acetabula, or little horny
rings and hooks, are more important than the most splendid
examples of the spathose durable osselet. The guards
should be selected with especial reference to their containing
the phragmocone (see <a href="#lign_141"><i>Lign.</i> 141</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2), or chambered conical
shell, in the alveolus or cavity of the upper and larger
end. An apparently worthless fragment of a Belemnite
will often be found to possess this part of the structure, as
in the example figured, which, until fractured longitudinally,
had been thrown by among useless duplicates. The
search for the remains of the fossil naked Cephalopoda, as
the Teuthid&aelig; and Sepiad&aelig;, and their ink-bags, must be
made in a like cautious manner. In the Lias marls, the
ink-bag and its duct is often found partially covered by a
pellicle of nacre, without any trace of the other parts of the
animal. A reference to Dr. Buckland&#8217;s plates (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxviii.
xxix) will familiarize the student with the appearance of
these fossil remains.</p>

<p>Of the first, third, fourth, and sixth of these classes,
remains occur in the British strata, some being referable to
existing, but the greater part to extinct species and genera.
I propose to describe a few illustrative examples of the
fossils belonging to each Class.</p>


<p><a id="Annelida"></a><span class="smcap">Annelida</span>.&mdash;This name is given to a class of <i>Articulata</i>,
consisting of worms, whose bodies are formed of little rings,
or annular segments, and which have red blood; as the
Leech, Earth-worm, &amp;c. Some are naked (the <i>Dorsibranchiata</i>
and <i>Abranchiata</i>), and move with great celerity; as
the <i>Gordius</i>, or Hair-worm, and the <i>Nereis</i>, so frequent on
the sands of the sea-shore. Others have shelly coverings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504"> 504 </a></span>
(the <i>Tubicol&aelig;</i>), as the <i>Serpula</i>, and are sedentary, or fixed
to other bodies. The soft bodies of certain species are
protected by a coat, or tube, formed by the agglutination of
sand, or other foreign substances, as in the <i>Sabella</i> (<a href="#lign_123"><i>Lign.</i> 123</a>,
 <i>fig.</i> 6, p. 385).</p>

<p>The fossil remains of the testaceous Annelides are very
abundant in some deposits; and even the naked, flexible,
soft-bodied forms have left proofs of their existence in some
of the most ancient sedimentary rocks. Traces of nine
species, belonging to five genera of these soft, naked Annelides,
have been observed in the Silurian strata of Britain.</p>

<p>The first notice of these remarkable remains appeared in
the invaluable work of Sir R. I. Murchison on the Silurian
System.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The living species of <span class="smcap">Nereis</span> (<i>Dorsibranchiate</i>) are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505"> 505 </a></span>
free, agile animals, having a distinct head, provided with
either eyes or antenn&aelig;, or both; they are the most perfect
in structure of all the Annelides. The fossil represented in
<a href="#lign_166"><i>Lign.</i> 166</a> indicates that the body of the original was composed
of about one hundred and twenty segments; the feet
were half the length of a segment of the body; and the <i>cirri</i>
of the feet were longer than such segment. A more slender
species, (<i>Nereites Sedgwickii</i>,) the body consisting of a greater
number of segments, is also figured and described by Sir
It. I. Murchison. Other impressions in the same stone
resemble those that would be produced by smooth Annelides
(<i>Abranchiate</i>) related to the <i>Gordius</i>, or Hair-worm.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Serpula.</span>&mdash;The animals of this genus are sedentary or
fixed, having calcareous tubes or shells, but to which they
have no muscular attachment. They have plumose or arborescent
gills affixed to the anterior part of the body. The
shelly tubes of the <i>Serpul&aelig;</i> are constantly seen on our coasts,
encrusting stones, rocks, shells, sea-weeds, &amp;c., and may be
known by their contorted or twisted forms. There are a hundred
and fifty British fossil Tubicol&aelig;. A large species has
been discovered in the Silurian rocks (<i>Murch. Sil. Syst.</i> pl. v.
<i>fig.</i> 1); several occur in the Carboniferous, Oolitic, and
Cretaceous, and many in the Tertiary strata. In the Upper
Chalk, a smooth tortuous <i>Serpula</i> is not uncommon (<i>S.
plexus</i>, <i>Min. Conch</i>, tab. 598); it occurs in masses several
inches long. But I have not observed either in the Chalk,
or in any other deposit, indications of banks of <i>Serpulid&aelig;</i>,
like those now in progress off the Bermudas, and which
resemble coral-reefs in their solidity and extent.</p>

<p><a id="Cirripedia"></a><span class="smcap">Cirripedia.</span>&mdash;These animals have a soft body, enveloped
in a membrane, which in some genera is protected only by
a horny sheath, but in general is enclosed in a shell composed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506"> 506 </a></span>
of various calcareous plates.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> They have six pairs
of feet, terminating in long, slender, articulated tentacula,
furnished with cilia, and coiled up like tendrils at the extremities
near the mouth. The name of the class (<i>curled-feet</i>)
has originated from the appearance presented by the curled
tentacula when projecting from the oval aperture of the
shell. The testaceous Cirripedes or <i>Barnacles</i> are divided
into two groups; namely, the <i>sessile</i>, or those which in
their adult state are fixed by the base to other bodies,
(<span class="smcap">Balanid&aelig;</span>,) as the Acorn-shell, or <i>Balanus</i>; and the <i>pedunculated</i>,
which have a process of attachment, peduncle or
stem, (<span class="smcap">Lepadid&aelig;</span>,) as the Duck-barnacle, or <i>Lepas</i>. But the
young animals of these genera have powerful locomotive
organs, and are capable of swimming, by sudden jerks, like
some of the crustaceans, to which class, especially in this
stage of their existence, they closely approach. But after a
short period of freedom, the young Cirripede fixes itself in
some locality suitable to its economy, and rapidly undergoes
the transformation which results in the sessile adult
Barnacle or Lepas.<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_432" id="Footnote_432"></a><a href="#FNanchor_432"><span class="label">[432]</span></a> Until within the last few years the valves of the <i>Cirripedes</i> have
been generally figured and described in works on Conchology as
being allied to the <i>Mollusca</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_433" id="Footnote_433"></a><a href="#FNanchor_433"><span class="label">[433]</span></a> See Mr. C. Darwin&#8217;s admirable Monograph on the Cirripedia,

<p><span class="smcap">Balanus.</span> <a href="#lign_167"><i>Lign. 167, fig. 1.</i></a>&mdash;The shell of this sessile
Cirripede is of a conical shape and cellular structure. It
consists of a thick plate at the base, or place of attachment;
of a series of plates, united by sutures, arranged around the
body of the animal, and called <i>parietal</i> valves; and of pieces
termed <i>opercular</i> valves, by which the aperture is closed.
The shell of the <i>Balanus</i>, so common on the rocks of our
shores, and on every pile and pier within reach of the tide,
is composed of six parietal, and four opercular valves. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507"> 507 </a></span>
fossil <i>Balanus</i>, <a href="#lign_167"><i>Lign.</i> 167</a>. <i>fig.</i> 1, is from the <span class="smcap">Crag</span>, a formation
containing many shells of this genus: in this example,
the six parietal plates of the conical shell only remain, but
in some specimens the opercular valves are also preserved.
There are about twelve species of Balanus in the Crag; but
none have been found either in the older Tertiary, or in the
secondary rocks of England. In the newer <i>Pliocene</i> deposits
of the Sub-Apennines, and of North America, several
species are common.</p>

common <i>Duck-barnacle</i> is a well-known example, have a
strong, muscular, hollow stalk, or peduncle, which supports
a multivalve shell, containing the body of the animal. In
<i>Pollicipes</i> and <i>Scalpellum</i> there are small calcareous plates
covering the junction of the body with the peduncle. Detached
valves of several species of these two genera are met

<p><a id="Crustacea"></a><span class="smcap">Crustacea.</span>&mdash;The animals whose fossil remains we have
now to consider, are characterised by their crustaceous
external integument or shell, which is disposed in segments,
more or less distinct, the annular portions supporting articulated
limbs or appendages. They are aquatic, free, locomotive
beings, and possess distinct <i>branchi&aelig;</i>, or organs
fitted for aquatic respiration. The Crab and Lobster are
examples of those tribes in which the external crust is calcareous,
and "coloured by a pigmental substance, diffused
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509"> 509 </a></span>
more or less irregularly through it; and is formed upon and
by a vascular organized integument, or corium, which is
lined by the smooth serous membrane of the visceral cavities."
(<i>Owen.</i>) The subdivisions of this class have relation
to the forms, combinations, and proportions of the primary
rings or segments of the external crust or integument, but it
will not be requisite for our present purpose to enter upon
this department of the subject. It may, however, be necessary
to mention, that in the normal type of Crustaceans,
the integument consists of twenty-one rings or segments,
which form the three regions into which the body is divided;
namely, the head or <i>cephalic</i>, the <i>thoracic</i>, and the <i>abdominal</i>;
each of which is assumed to consist of seven rings,
although some of these are generally anchylosed, and form
but one segment; and even the three regions are occasionally
more or less blended together. The cephalic portion
of the crust contains the principal organs of sense, and
the commencement of the digestive apparatus, and includes
the masticatory appendages. The <i>thoracic</i> portion is formed
of the rings to which the extremities serving for locomotion
are attached: and, together with the cephalic, contains
almost all the viscera. The consolidation of the rings or
segments takes place most generally in the cephalic, and
next in frequency in the thoracic; and but rarely occurs in
the abdominal region. These animals possess organs of
sight variously modified, and in some species highly complicated;
some have smooth or simple eyes (<i>stemmata</i>), and
others compound eyes, like those of insects, with distinct
facets. In one grand division (called <i>Edriopthalmia</i>), the
eyes are sessile and immovable; in the other (<i>Podopthalmia</i>),
they are supported upon moveable stems or peduncles.
These few remarks on the organization of the recent crustaceans
are required, to make our description of the fossil
remains intelligible to the general reader. As the shell, or
calcareous integument, even in those species in which it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510"> 510 </a></span>
very dense and thick, is moulded upon the soft parts it
envelopes, the experienced naturalist is able, from its configuration
alone, to obtain certain conclusions as to the form,
size, and position of the contained viscera; and, as these
animals annually shed their solid case and acquire a new
one, which is moulded on the soft parts, the form and relative
situation of the internal organs must necessarily be
faithfully represented by the external integument, even
when it has acquired its greatest degree of consolidation;
thus the regions of the stomach, heart, branchi&aelig; or respiratory
organs, &amp;c. may be distinctly traced on the external
shell. Hence the fossil carapaces may afford important
data regarding the structure and economy of the extinct
species. M. Desmarest<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> was the first naturalist who successfully
applied this <i>phrenological method</i> to the investigation
of the fossil crustaceans.</p>

<p>The fossil remains of Crustaceans consist of the calcareous
covering or carapace, with the articulated extremities,
and, rarely, the jaws and antenn&aelig;. For the most part, the
specimens are mutilated, and present only portions of the
carapace, abdominal segments, and detached claws; but in
strata composed of very fine detritus, such as the cream-coloured
limestones of Solenhofen and Pappenheim, examples
often occur in the most beautiful state of preservation, appearing
as if the animals had been carefully embalmed in a
soft paste, that had quickly consolidated around them, and
preserved them without mutilation or blemish. In some
examples, even the colour of the original remains. The
specimens found in hard limestones and coarse conglomerates
are generally mutilated, and, as the under surface of
the carapace, and the sternal plates to which the legs are
attached, present more irregularity than the dorsal portion
of the shell, they are firmly impacted in the stone, so as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511"> 511 </a></span>
render the development of some of the most important characters
difficult, if not impossible. The antenn&aelig; and claws
are often separated, or altogether wanting; the most common
relics being the pincers and the carapace, or united
cephalo-thoracic segments. The substance of the shell,
which in the recent state consists of phosphate and carbonate
of lime, with gelatine or cartilage, is commonly a
friable carbonate of lime, tinged with oxide of iron. These
remarks apply more particularly to the crabs, lobsters,
shrimps, prawns, &amp;c. Numerous species of the smaller crustaceans,
as the <i>Cypris</i>, and the extinct family of <i>Trilobites</i>,
occur in myriads, and, in some formations, are the principal
constituent of deposits of great thickness and extent.</p>

<p>The remains of this class have been found throughout the
vast series of the fossiliferous strata. Extinct forms appear
in prodigious numbers in the most ancient formations, and
are succeeded by genera which approach more nearly to the
more highly organized crustaceans. The Crab and Lobster
tribes are represented by certain species in the Lias, Oolite,
and Chalk; while in many of the Tertiary strata the existing
types prevail.</p>

<p>The London Clay, in the Isle of Sheppey, yields many
beautiful examples of the higher order of crustaceans, as the
Crab, Lobster, &amp;c. In the Chalk these remains are more
rare, but a few fine specimens have been obtained. On the
Continent, certain localities are extremely rich in these remains.
Upwards of sixty species were discovered by Count
M&uuml;nster in the Jura limestone, at Solenhofen; and the
Muschelkalk of Germany has yielded several extinct genera.
The beautiful state in which these fossils occur, is exemplified
in the specimen from Solenhofen, figured in the frontispiece
of this work; <a href="#Plate_I"><i>Pl. I. fig. 2</i></a>.</p>

the <i>Anomura</i> (abnormal-tailed), there are remains of several
genera in the Tertiary deposits. The Isle of Sheppey is the
most productive locality in England. The carapaces of
several kinds occur in the septaria and nodules of indurated
clay; the chelate hand-claws (<i>pincer-claws</i>) are often found
detached, and sometimes in connexion with the shield. The
most numerous specimens are referable to two species. One

<p>A species of Crab, characterised by its relatively large
claws, is common in the soft Tertiary limestone of Malta;
and examples, in a fine state of preservation, are often seen
in cabinets; see <i>Wond.</i> p. 251.</p>

<p>I am not aware that vestiges of more than one genus of
brachyurous crustaceans have been observed in the British
Secondary formations; namely, the <i>Podopilumnus Fittoni</i>
(M&#8216;Coy), from the Greensand of Lyme Regis: but several
small species belonging to the anomurous group have been
found in the Galt.</p>

<p>In the <i>Galt</i> at Ringmer, a village near Lewes, I discovered,
many years since, four or five species of small crustaceans,
which are figured and described, <i>Foss. South D.</i> pl.
xxiv.; their natural relations were pointed out to me by
the late eminent naturalist, Dr. Leach. Specimens of two
of the species have since been collected at Folkstone, but as
these are only the carapaces, no additional light has been
thrown upon the structure of the originals.</p>

<p>The smallest species consists of the carapace or cephalo-thoracic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513"> 513 </a></span>
segments, united into a transversely obovate, obscurely
trilobate shell, the surface of which is covered with
minute irregular papill&aelig;; with four tubercles on each lateral
portion, and an irregularly tuberculated dorsal ridge (see
<a href="#lign_168"><i>Lign.</i> 168</a>, fig. 1, 1<i>a</i>.); it probably belongs to the genus
<span class="smcap">Etyus</span>; and I have named it <i>Etyus Martini</i>, in honour of

established by Professor M&#8217;Coy, 1849.</p></div>

<p>There are two species that appear to have some relations
with <i>Corystes</i>, a genus which includes several recent crustaceans
that inhabit our shores, and are characterised by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514"> 514 </a></span>
elongated oval shell and four antenn&aelig;, the external pair
being long, setaceous, and furnished with two rows of cilia.
The tail is folded under the body when the animal is in
repose. They have ten legs, the anterior pair <i>chelate</i> (<i>with
pincers</i>), the others terminating in an acute elongated nail
or claw. The fossils consist of the carapace, and one example
possesses the inferior or thoracic plates and the remains of
the bases of some of the legs (see <a href="#lign_168"><i>Lign.</i> 168</a>, fig. 3<i>a</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notopocorystes Stokesii.</span> <a href="#lign_168"><i>Lign. 168, fig. 2.</i></a>&mdash;The carapace
is relatively wider than in most species of this genus;
is has a strong dorsal ridge of irregular oblong tubercles;
the union of the cephalic and thoracic segments is marked
by a transverse undulated groove; there are three or four
tubercles on the surface of each lateral portion of the former,
and one on each of the latter. The whole surface is finely
granulated. The openings left by the attachment of the
peduncles of the eye remain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notopocorystes Broderipii.</span> <a href="#lign_168"><i>Lign. 168, fig. 3.</i></a>&mdash;This
species, like the former, has a transverse undulated furrow,
indicating the union of the cephalic with the thoracic segments;
the dorsal ridge is smooth, and there are two tubercles
on each lateral cephalic portion of the shield. The
carapace is longitudinally ovate, much depressed, with three
sharp points directed forwards on each margin of the anterior
part: the whole surface is finely granulated. In the
specimen <i>fig.</i> 3<i>a</i> the sternal plates, with portions of the first
joints of the claws, remain; one example (figured <i>Geol. S. E.</i>
p. 169) possessed six or seven arcuate abdominal segments,
which were turned under the body.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_441" id="Footnote_441"></a><a href="#FNanchor_441"><span class="label">[441]</span></a> I have described these small crustaceans somewhat minutely, and
have given them specific names, in the hope of directing the attention
of collectors to these highly interesting relics, and leading to the discovery
of more illustrative examples. See Foss. South D. pp. 96, 97.</p></div>

<p>The carapace or shell of the other crustacean observed in
the Sussex Galt (<i>Notopocorystes Bechei</i>) is of an orbicular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515"> 515 </a></span>
inflated form (see <i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 169, <i>fig.</i> 3), and ornamented
with twelve or thirteen aculeated tubercles; its margin is
dentated.</p>

<p>In the friable arenaceous limestone of the Cretaceous
formation at St. Peter&#8217;s Mountain, near Maestricht, the cheliferous
claws of a small kind of crustacean (<i>Mesostylus
Faujasii</i>, <i>Wond.</i> p. 338), are frequently discovered (and
occasionally in the Chalk of Kent and Sussex), but with no
vestige of the carapace or shell. This curious fact is explained
by the analogy existing between the fossil claws and
those of the <i>Pagurus</i>, or Hermit-crab, whose body is only
covered by a delicate membrane, the claws alone having
a calcareous covering; hence the latter might be preserved
in a fossil state, while no traces of the soft parts remained.
In the fossil, as in the recent claws, the right arm is the
strongest. There is no doubt that the crustaceans to which
the fossil claws belonged possessed the same modification of
structure as the recent (anomurous) Hermit-crab, and must
have sought shelter in the shells of the mollusks with
which their durable remains are associated.</p>


<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL LOBSTERS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Lobsters.</span>&mdash;The <i>macrurous</i>, or long-tailed, crustaceans,
as the <i>Lobster</i>, are distinguished from those of the
former divisions by the prolonged abdomen (or tail, as it is
commonly termed), which forms a powerful instrument of
locomotion, and enables the animal to dart backwards
through the water with great rapidity; and this is furnished
with an appendage or tail, which none of the ambulatory
crustaceans possess.</p>

<p>Of the fresh-water species, the Cray-fish (<i>Astacus fluviatilis</i>),
and of the marine, the Lobster (<i>Astacus marinus</i>), are
illustrative examples. The remains of three macrurous
species occur in the London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey,
associated with congenerous crustaceans; and the segments
of the tails (<i>post-abdomen</i>) are often well preserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516"> 516 </a></span></p>

<p>The Chalk contains a few species of the <i>Macrura</i>, which
were first discovered in the quarries near Lewes, and are
figured in <i>Foss. South D.</i> tab. xxx. xxxi.; they are among
the most rare and delicate of the fossils of the Cretaceous
strata. These remains consist of the carapace and claws,
and rarely of the tail and antenn&aelig;, and are composed of a
friable earthy crust, which, when first discovered, is of a
dark chocolate colour, but quickly changes to a pale fawn,
or reddish brown, by exposure to the air. In the specimens
obtained by breaking the stone, the crustaceous covering
remains attached by its rough external surface to one portion
of chalk, and on the corresponding piece are sharp casts
of the carapace and claws, having a glossy surface covered
with minute papill&aelig; formed by the bases of tubercles or
spines. Four species have been observed.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Enoploclytia Leachii.</span> <a href="#lign_169"><i>Lign.</i> 169</a>, <i>figs.</i> 1, 2, 3.&mdash;This is
a long delicate crustacean, having a pair of equal, slender,
anterior chelate claws, the fingers of which are long, attenuated,
and armed with a row of obtuse cylindrical spines.
The surface of the hand-claws is muricated, or covered with
short erect aculeated tubercles. The pincers in the specimen
figured <a href="#lign_169"><i>Lign.</i> 169</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3, are shorter than in most examples.
The carapace is elongated and sub-cylindrical, with
a dorsal ridge and two lateral furrows, indicating the normal
division of the cephalic and thoracic segments of the
shield; the antenn&aelig; are long, filiform, and setaceous
(<i>bristly</i>), and are placed on squamous peduncles (see <a href="#lign_169"><i>Lign.</i> 169</a>,
 <i>fig.</i> 2).</p>

<p>There appear to have been five legs on each side; the
anterior or chelate pair are the most usual relics of this
animal; of the other claws and the branchi&aelig;, but obscure
indications have been obtained. The abdominal segments
are arcuate, and six or seven in number; their surface is
granulated; the appendage, or tail, is foliaceous and marginate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517"> 517 </a></span>
with a few longitudinal ridges (see <a href="#lign_169"><i>Lign.</i> 169</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1).<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a>
The claws of these crustaceans may be easily recognised by
their general aspect, and the length and straightness of the
fingers or pincers. In most examples traces remain of the
tendinous expansion of the muscles of the moveable claw
(see <a href="#lign_169"><i>Lign.</i> 169</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3).</p>

Mr. Dixon, on the Fossils of Sussex, there are figures of very fine
specimens of these two species of Enoploclytia (plate xxxviii*.) with
detailed descriptions by Prof. Bell (p. 344); but unfortunately, from
inadvertence, no reference is made to my former drawings and descriptions
of these fossil Lobsters of the Chalk, and new names are
given by the Professor; <i>E. Leachii</i> appearing as "Pal&aelig;astacus macrodactylus,"
and <i>E. Sussexiensis</i> as "P. Dixoni." I need scarcely remind
my readers that according to the established rules of Nomenclature
the <i>earlier specific names</i> must be preserved; and that, Prof. M&#8216;Coy
having already indicated the distinction of these fossils from the
recent <i>Astacus</i> by providing an appropriate generic appellation, these
new names are altogether inadmissible.</p></div>

<p>Claws of other <i>Astacid&aelig;</i> have been found in the Chalk of
Sussex and Kent; one species in particular is distinguished
from those previously described by its short curved pincers,
and granulated surface;<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> and remains of other species of

<p>The "Lobster-clays" in the Lower Greensand, or Neocomian,
beds at Atherfield afford numerous fine specimens of a
small long-clawed crustacean, allied to <i>Astacus</i>; a fine specimen
is figured in the <i>Geology of the Isle of Wight</i>, title-page
vignette, and see page 232. One or more species,
apparently distinct from those of Atherfield, have been discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519"> 519 </a></span>
by Mr. Beckles in beds of clay that appear to occupy
the line of junction between the Wealden and Greensand,
on the Sussex coast, between Pevensey and Bexhill.</p>

<p>Imperfect claws of <i>Astacid&aelig;</i> have also been found at
other places in the Shanklin Sand; and I have collected
from the Galt at Ringmer, the abdominal segments of a
small species, resembling <i>Meyeria ornata</i>, <a href="#lign_170"><i>Lign.</i> 170</a>.</p>

<p>A remarkable macrurous crustacean (<i>Eryon Cuvieri</i>) is
found in the Jurassic limestone of Solenhofen. Perfect specimens
of this species are occasionally seen in collections; it is
distinguished by its very large, flat, oval shell, with the front
lateral margins strongly dentated, and by its short setaceous
antenn&aelig;; the front claws are as long as the body, and
armed with pincers; the post-abdomen consists of six segments,
terminating in a caudal appendage or tail.</p>

this order had been noticed in the British strata, until the
discovery of the <i>Arch&aelig;oniscus</i> in the Purbeck strata by the
Rev. P. B. Brodie. The quarry in which these relics were
found is situated at Dallards, near the village of Dinton,
about twelve miles west of Salisbury. They are principally
distributed in a bed of light-brown and grey limestone, in
the lower part of which are numerous fresh-water bivalves
(<i>cyclades</i>), and a few small oysters. These Isopods often
occur in clusters (see <a href="#lign_171"><i>Lign.</i> 171</a>); the lenses of the compound
eyes are sometimes detectable in the limestone, and,
rarely, attached to the head; traces of legs have been observed,
but no antenn&aelig;. In the same stratum the <i>elytron</i>
(sheath, or wing-case) of a coleopterous insect was discovered.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522"> 522 </a></span>
Mr. Brodie has obtained specimens an inch and
a half in length, and an inch broad. These fossils appear to
have been deposited tranquilly at the bottom of the water

and thorax are blended together, and the superior abdominal
shield, which is composed of confluent segments, appears like
one piece, and has an indistinct trilobed character; the last
segment is prolonged into a three-edged, sharp, styliform
weapon. The Limulus has two reniform, compound eyes,
composed of facets of a peculiar form. The gills are disposed
on lamelliform processes. It is distinguished from all
other crustaceans by the mastication of its food being performed
by the first joint of the thoracic legs which surround
the mouth, instead of by jaws.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Eurypterus</span> and Pterygotus are pal&aelig;ozoic crustaceans,

from the Limulus chiefly in having the segments of
the abdomen freely articulating with each other.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> The
<i>Eurypterus</i> was first described by Mr. Dekay, in the United
States, probably from the Carboniferous system. The head
is round, the thoracic and cephalic portions of the carapace
being blended together, and the abdominal region is
formed of eleven segments, with a caudal appendage. It
has two depressed, lunated eyes, remote from each other,
and eight feet, the anterior pairs furnished with <i>branchi&aelig;</i>,
and the hindmost pair relatively larger than in any other
crustacean. Two American species are described; the one
is five, and the other about four inches long.<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> In the Carboniferous

<p><span class="smcap">Pterygotus.</span>&mdash;In the Old Red sandstone of Forfarshire,
and other parts of Scotland, the remains of this remarkable
crustacean have been long known to the quarry-men by the
name of "<i>petrified Seraphims</i>;" from an imaginary resemblance
of the expanded post-abdomen to the usual representations
of those ideal beings! This genus is characterised
by the angular carapace, which forms a lozenge-shaped
shield; and the appendage of the post-abdomen, which,
instead of being divided into segments, as in most animals
of this class, is a continuous flap. The eye-pits on the
carapace are like those of Eurypterus, but are very large.
The claws resemble those of the common lobster. The
external crustaceous covering is ornamented with circular
and elliptical markings, producing an imbricated or scaly
appearance, the imprints of which gave rise to the enigmatical
"Seraphims" of the Forfarshire sandstone. Some
specimens indicate a total length of four feet!<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>Several fossil genera of the Entomostracous Crustaceans
belong to the <i>Phyllopoda</i> (<i>leaf-feet</i>), which constitute a subdivision
of the <span class="smcap">Branchiopoda</span> (<i>gill-feet</i>). Of these perhaps
the most remarkable is the Dithyrocaris, first discovered by
Dr. Scouler in the Carboniferous shale near Paisley. This
genus is allied to the recent <i>Apus</i>, and, like it, has a broad,
flat, thin carapace, easily divisible down the middle of the
back, and a lengthened tail or post-abdomen, with a trifid
termination. Six species have been found in the Carboniferous
deposits of the British Isles.</p>

<p>Ceratiocaris and Hymenocaris, which are related to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526"> 526 </a></span>
recent <i>Nebalia</i>, are also of the Phyllopod group, and maybe
said to resemble a shrimp-like animal partly enclosed in a
bivalve carapace, while its tail is exposed, and either protruded,
or turned beneath the body. Of the first-mentioned
genus there are three Upper Silurian species; and of <i>Hymenocaris</i>
Mr. Salter has described a single species (<i>H. vermicanda</i>)
from the Lower Silurian (Cambrian) of North
Wales.</p>

<p>The <i>Limnadiad&aelig;</i>,&mdash;another Phyllopodous family, of which
the recent <i>Limnadia</i> is the type,&mdash;are well represented in
the older rocks. These Crustaceans are also bivalved, but
the body is wholly enclosed. They are of small size. <span class="smcap">Estheria</span>,
a genus closely related to Limnadia, occurs plentifully
in the Wealden of Sussex and Germany, and in the Lias of
Westbury. Mr. Bean also has noticed a species (<i>E. concentrica</i>)
in the Oolite shell of Gristhorpe Bay; and the <i>E. minuta</i><a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
is characteristic of the Keuper division of the Trias
in England and Europe.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_459" id="Footnote_459"></a><a href="#FNanchor_459"><span class="label">[459]</span></a> This was formerly described as a <i>Posidonomya</i>.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Leperditia</span> and <span class="smcap">Beyrichia</span> are other fossil genera belonging
to the <i>Limnadiad&aelig;</i>. These little crustaceans were gregarious
in their habit, and, like Estheria, occur locally in
great profusion. They are characteristic of the Silurian
deposits; the former being an abundant Upper Silurian
fossil in Europe and North America, and the latter,&mdash;a
very minute form,&mdash;both in the Upper and Lower Silurian.</p>


<p>The next group of Entomostraca that we have to notice
belongs to the <span class="smcap">Lophyropoda</span> (<i>feet crested with bristles</i>),
namely, the <span class="smcap">Ostracoda</span> (<i>shelled</i>). The recent genera, <i>Cypris</i>,
<i>Cythere</i>, and <i>Cypridina</i>,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> are types of the three families of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527"> 527 </a></span>
this group, and are the existing representatives of numerous

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528"> 528 </a></span>
The species of an allied genus, named <i>Cythere</i>, the shells of
which cannot always with certainty be distinguished in a
fossil state from those of <i>Cypris</i>, inhabit salt or brackish
waters. As the living <i>Cyprides</i> are interesting objects for
microscopic examination, they are commonly shown in the
exhibitions of the hydro-oxygen microscope, and their appearance
is therefore well known. Two recent species are
figured in <i>Ly.</i> p. 183. These animals have the body enclosed
in a bivalve, horny case, the two pieces being united by a
hinge-line. They have four feet, and two pairs of antenn&aelig;,
with a pencil of cilia at the extremities; and one compound
eye. They swim with rapidity, by means of their ciliated
antenn&aelig;, and crawl about actively on the water-weeds and
other subaqueous surfaces. Like the other crustaceans, they
frequently moult or cast their cases, and the surface of the
mud spread over the bottoms of still lakes is often covered
with their exuvi&aelig;. The largest living Cypris (<i>C. clavata</i>)
does not exceed one-eighth of an inch in length. The fossil
cases or shells of Cyprides are found in considerable variety
and in prodigious numbers in certain Tertiary and Secondary
strata, which appear to have been deposited by fresh-water;
as, for example, in the lacustrine marls of Auvergne (<i>Ly.</i>
p. 183), and the fluviatile clays and limestones of the south-east
of England. They have not been observed in any
decidedly marine beds; but Mr. Lonsdale discovered in the
Chalk, by means of the microscope, cases of crustaceans,
that belong to the genus <i>Cythere</i> (<i>Ly.</i> p. 26, figs. 21-24),
the recent species of which inhabit the sea. One or more
species of Cypris have been observed in the older British
Tertiaries,&mdash;by Sir C. Lyell, in Hordwell Cliff (<i>Geol. Trans.</i>
2d ser. vol. iii. p. 288), and by Mr. Prestwich at Hempstead
Cliff (<i>Brit. Assoc.</i> 1846); but in the Pleistocene deposits
the Cypris and its congeners abound, and of these Mr.
R. Jones has enumerated nine species (<i>Annals Nat. Hist.</i>
2d ser. vol. iii.). In many districts on the Continent, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529"> 529 </a></span>
Eocene marls and clays abound in these remains. Some of
the fresh-water Tertiary strata of France contain myriads
of a Cypris (named <i>C. faba</i>, from its bean-like form) which
was formerly supposed, but erroneously, to be identical
with a species found in the Wealden. The laminated
marls of Auvergne contain, between every layer, countless
myriads of the shells of Cyprides, through a depth of
several hundred feet; although each lamina of marl scarcely
exceeds the thickness of paper. Near Clermont, the green
<i>cypridiferous</i> marls approach to within a few yards of the
granite which forms the borders of that ancient basin (<i>Ly.</i>
p. 184). In the eastern portion of the basaltic districts of
India, Mr. Malcolmson has discovered two species of Cypris,
associated with fresh-water univalves and bivalves.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> In England
the principal deposits of the Cyprides, are the clays
and limestones of the Wealden and the Isle of Purbeck,<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> to
the composition of which the relics of these minute beings
have largely contributed. Entire layers of their cases are
found in the laminated clays and marls on the southern
shores of the Isle of Wight, at Atherfield and Sandown Bay,
where some of the Wealden beds emerge from beneath the
lower division of the Shanklin sand. Upon splitting the
clay in the direction of the lamin&aelig;, the exposed surfaces are
found to be covered with these minute bodies; as in the
specimen, <a href="#lign_174"><i>Lign.</i> 174</a>, fig. 5.</p>

<p>The appearance of four characteristic Wealden Cyprides,
of their natural size and magnified, is shown in <a href="#lign_174"><i>Lign.</i> 174</a>.
The one named <i>C. Valdensis</i>, or Wealden Cypris, by Dr.
Fitton and Mr. Sowerby (fig. 1), is the most frequent, and
occurs in numerous localities in Kent and Sussex. A Cypris
having the case studded with relatively large tubercles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530"> 530 </a></span>
(fig. 3), is found in many of the finer sandstones of Tilgate
forest; another, with the shell tuberculated, but divided
by a transverse ridge (fig. 2), indicating a rudimentary condition
of the segments which characterise the class, is certainly
distinct from the former, and can have no name
more appropriate than that of <i>C. Fittoni</i>. The other beautiful
species (<i>C. granulosa</i>, fig. 4) has the surface of the case
covered with granules. One more species has been observed
in the Weald clay, at Sandown Bay and Atherfield (by Mr.
Lonsdale); it is distinguished by a short conical spine on
each valve, and is therefore named <i>C. spinigera</i>. In the
Weald clay at Resting-oak-hill, near Cooksbridge (<i>Geol.
S. E.</i> p. 187), <i>C. Valdensis</i> is so abundant, that every thin
flake is covered with its white calcareous shells; and upon
breaking the nodules and septaria of reddish-brown ironstone
which occur in that locality, myriads of beautiful
sharp casts of the cases are observable in almost every fragment.
They are associated with fresh-water bivalves and
univalves (<i>Cyclas</i> and <i>Paludina</i>), and minute scales of
fishes. The sandstone at Langton Green, near Tunbridge
Wells, which contains casts and impressions of several species
of fresh-water shells, abounds in <i>Cyprides</i>; and the layers
of argillaceous ironstone, interstratified with the sandstone
in one of the quarries, are particularly rich in these remains.
The surface of a recently broken slab is often covered by
minute, polished, oblong, convex bodies, which are the casts
of cypridean carapaces.</p>

<p>The Sussex marble is largely composed of the remains of
these minute crustaceans. Upon examining thin polished
slices of this limestone under the microscope, the cavities
and interstices of the shells are found to be filled with the
shields of Cyprides, entire or in fragments; and some specimens
of the Purbeck marble equally abound in these remains.
The Purbeck marls, as well as the limestones, often
abound with Cyprides. According to Prof. E. Forbes, these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531"> 531 </a></span>
belong to several species, all more or less distinct from those
of the Wealden (<i>Brit. Association</i>, 1850). The Cyprides of the
Wealden of Germany have been figured and described by Dr.
Dunker; and several of the British forms are found there.</p>

<p>As the recent species inhabit still lakes, or gently running
streams, and not the turbulent waters of estuaries, we cannot
doubt that the strata in which these animals so largely predominate
were deposited in lakes or bays, communicating
with the river which transported to their present situation
the bones and other remains of the colossal reptiles of the
Wealden. And the beds of fresh-water snails, with scarcely
any intermixture of other organic remains but the Cyprides,
which are spread over extensive areas in the Wealden and
Purbeck districts, appear to afford corroborative proof of
this inference.</p>

<p>Four species of minute bivalved Entomostraca from the
Carboniferous deposits have been referred to <i>Cypris</i>: viz.
<i>C. arcuata</i>, Bean, from the Coal-shale at Newcastle; <i>C. inflata</i>,
Murchison, Coal-measures, near Shrewsbury; <i>C. Scoto-Burdigalensis</i>,
Hibbert, Coal-measures at Burdie-house, and
Coal-shale at Derry; and <i>C. subrecta</i>, Portlock, also from
Derry, Tyrone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cythere.</span><a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a>&mdash;This animal differs but little from Cypris
except in having an additional pair of feet. In the Subgenus
<span class="smcap">Cythereis</span> the valves are thick, oblong, and strongly
hinged; thus differing from the thin and more or less oval
valves of the true Cythere and of Cypris. Several species
of <i>Cythere</i> and its sub-genera occur in the Tertiary, Cretaceous,
Oolitic, Liassic, Permian, and Carboniferous deposits.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trilobites.</span>&mdash;Among the numerous petrifactions which
are found in the limestones in the neighbourhood of Dudley,
in Staffordshire, there are certain fossil bodies which, from
their extraordinary form and appearance, have for more than
a hundred and fifty years been objects of great interest to
the naturalist, and of wonder to the general observer, and
have long been provincially termed <i>Dudley insects</i>, or
<i>locusts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> By the earlier naturalists these fossils were referred
to fishes, to molluscs, and to insects, before their real
character was discovered. The most common type consists
of a convex, oblong body, divided transversely into three
principal parts, and longitudinally into three lobes, by two
deep, parallel furrows; this last character suggested the
name <i>Trilobita</i>, or <i>Trilobites</i>, by which the family is now
distinguished by naturalists.</p>

<p>These fossils are the carapaces, or shells, of crustaceans,

<p>In the Trilobites the head is distinct, and without antenn&aelig;,
and the feet are supposed to have been rudimentary,
soft, and membranaceous: the essential characters which
separate them from all other crustaceans, except <i>Bopyrus</i> (a
parasite on the branchi&aelig; of the common prawn), are, according
to Mr. Macleay, the deficiency of antenn&aelig;, and of lateral
posterior abdominal appendages, and the presence of evanescent
feet. Like other crustaceans, the Trilobites were
subject to the process of metamorphosis during their early
stages of life; and M. Barrande has ascertained that one
species, the <i>Sa&ouml; hirsuta</i>, appeal&#8217;s in no less than twenty different
stages of development. In its earliest, embryonic
condition, it is a simple disk, and it passes through various
stages until it becomes a perfect adult trilobite, having
seventeen free thoracic segments and two caudal joints.
No less than ten genera and eighteen species were instituted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535"> 535 </a></span>
by pal&aelig;ontologists on <i>some</i> of the forms only which this one
species presents in its different stages of metamorphosis,
before M. Barrande&#8217;s laborious and long-continued investigations
gave him an insight into the true relations of these
various conditions of the same animal to one another. This
talented and indefatigable pal&aelig;ontologist has arrived at
like results with other Trilobites, and has been enabled to
add greatly to our knowledge of the natural history and
geological distribution of this interesting group of crustaceans.

<p>The <i>Trilobites</i> have been arranged in numerous genera,

characters, but in others have reference to the obscurity

rounded in front, with a broad border, and divided into
three lobes by two longitudinal depressions. The eyes are
two in number, compound, and have numerous facets; they
are situated on the sides of the head, remote from each
other. The carapace is deeply trilobed by two longitudinal
furrows; the thoracic portion is composed of thirteen segments;

perovalis</i>, <i>Murch.</i>) <a href="#lign_175"><i>Lign.</i> 175</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1, will serve to illustrate
these characters.</p>


<p>The Trilobite called <span class="smcap">Bumastus</span> by Sir R. Murchison (from
its grape-like form) presents a very curious modification of
the normal type. Both the head and caudal extremity are
rounded, with no distinct longitudinal furrows; and the
whole surface of the carapace is covered by extremely thin,
apparently imbricated, lamell&aelig;, the edges of which are undulated,
and the intermediate spaces studded with minute
dots. The eyes are smooth, and not granulose, as in Calymene.
This genus is known in England by the name of the
<span class="smcap">Barr Trilobite</span>, from its occurrence in the limestone near
Barr, in Staffordshire; it is sometimes five inches long, and
three and a half wide (<i>Geol. Surv. Decade 2</i>, pl. iii. and iv.).</p>


<p>The genus <span class="smcap">Ogygia</span> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xlvi. fig. 9) is characterised by
the elliptical and depressed form of the carapace, its nearly
balanced extremities, and the prolongation of the buckler,
or cephalic portion, on each side, into slender spikes, distinct
from the body; the thoracic and abdominal regions are
divided by two deep, longitudinal furrows, into three lobes;
there is also a straight, longitudinal groove, in the front of
the buckler (see figures and descriptions of <i>O. Buchii</i>, <i>Geol.
Surv. Decade 2</i>). The Trilobites of this genus are found in
the Lower Silurian rocks of North Wales and Ireland; they
occur also in great abundance in the slate rocks of Angers,
and some species are more than a foot in length.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538"> 538 </a></span></p>

<p>Some species of the genus <span class="smcap">Phacops</span> have long, pointed
caudal appendages, as the <i>P.</i> (formerly <i>Asaphus</i>) <i>caudatus</i>
(<a href="#lign_177"><i>Lign.</i> 177</a>; <i>Bd.</i> pl. xlv. figs. 10, 10&#8242;; and <i>Geol. Surv. Decade 2</i>,
pl. i.). The eyes are often well preserved, and each contains
about 240 spherical lenses.</p>

the cephalic shield is obtuse, trilobed, rounded, and terminating
in lateral spikes; and its margin is marked by
numerous pit-like depressions. There are six body-rings or
thoracic segments. The caudal shield is large and somewhat
triangular. There are no distinct eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paradoxides.</span> <a href="#lign_178"><i>Lign.</i> 178</a>.&mdash;The Trilobites of this genus
are easily recognised by the ends of the lateral segments
of the thorax and abdomen terminating in deflected
points, which extend in spikes beyond the membrane they
supported, and particularly those near the tail, which are
much elongated; whereas in the other genera the lateral
points of the segments are united by a membrane, which
often forms a border beyond them. The cephalic buckler
is semicircular, and its lateral angles are lengthened out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539"> 539 </a></span>
behind into two strong spines; it is divided on the median
line into four protuberances, by transverse grooves. The
thorax consists of from sixteen to twenty segments; the
abdominal buckler is generally very small and rounded.
The animals of this genus have the body much depressed,
and the lateral lobes wider than the middle lobe: some
species are of considerable size, attaining several inches in
length.</p>

</div>

<p>A very peculiar form of Trilobite (<i>Brontes flabellifer</i>,
<i>Ly.</i> p. 348) is found in the Devonian strata of the Eifel
and South Devonshire; the head, or cephalic region, is
narrow, and has two lunated eyes; the thoracic region is
trilobed and short, and composed of about ten small articulations;
the abdominal very small, and bordered by segments,
which radiate and form a wide, fan-shaped expansion.
Other species of this genus occur in the Silurian rocks.</p>

<p>With regard to the under surface of the Trilobites much
remains to be known. No decided indications either of
antenn&aelig; or extremities have been discovered. In an American
specimen, Mr. Stokes detected a plate,<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> which appears
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540"> 540 </a></span>
to be a <i>labrum</i>, or upper mandible or lip, resembling that
of <i>Apus cancriformis</i>. This animal has a similar labrum,
"and lateral influted terminations of the shelly segments
of the body, with a distinctly trilobed <i>pygidium</i> (tail or
caudal portion), and a prolonged tail: the feet being foliaceous,
and the abdomen merely covered by a membrane."<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
In the upper or dorsal surface of the carapace the Trilobites
approach certain <i>Isopoda</i>, particularly in the characters of
the buckler and eyes. Mr. Macleay states that among the
existing crustaceans there are certain genera which individually
possess some one or more of the characters, which
have been thought peculiar to the extinct Trilobites. Thus
the <i>Serolis</i> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xlv. fig. 6), and the <i>Bopyrus</i>, have a
trilobed form; the female <i>Cymotho&aelig;</i> have the coriaceous
margin of the body, and in some species are without eyes
as are many of the Trilobites; while the eyes of the males
of some <i>Cymotho&aelig;</i> are composed of large facets, and are
situated on the back of the head, wide apart, as in the
<i>Calymene</i>; rudimentary feet, and the absence of antenn&aelig;
occur in <i>Bopyrus</i>; and lastly, the <i>Sph&aelig;roma</i> has an onisciform
body, and the power of rolling itself up into a ball, like
the Calymene (<a href="#lign_175"><i>Lign.</i> 175</a>, <i>fig.</i> 4). The analogy between the
Bopyrus and the Barr Trilobite is so close, that if the latter
had a body with thirteen equal segments, and short crustaceous
feet, it would be in every essential particular a male
<i>Bopyrus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> Burmeister regards the Trilobites as being related
to the <i>Branchipus</i>. From the absence of eyes in the
female, and their presence in the male of certain recent
genera of crustaceans, it is not improbable that a similar
character may have prevailed in the Trilobites, and that
certain fossils referred to different genera, from the presence
or absence of eyes, may have been the males and females
of the same species.</p>

<p>The habits of the Trilobites, as deducible from Mr.
Macleay&#8217;s exposition of their structure and affinities, must
have resembled those of the <i>Cymothoad&aelig;</i>, some of which,
like the Calymenes, coil themselves up, and are not parasitical;
while their close affinity to Bopyrus, and the apparent
absence of distinct crustaceous feet, imply that they were
to a certain degree sedentary. The flat under surface of
their bodies, and the lateral coriaceous margin of several
species, which is so analogous to that of the multivalve shell
<i>Chiton</i>, render it probable that they adhered by a soft, articulated,
under surface, to the rocks or sea-weeds. Their instruments
of progression are unknown; whether they moved
by means of membranaceous feet, or by the undulations
of setigerous segments, like the earth-worm, or by wrinkling
the under surface of the abdomen, like the Chiton,
are questions yet to be determined. It is evident, from
their longitudinally trilobed form, and lateral coriaceous
margin, that they had the power of firmly adhering to flat
surfaces; and while thus sedentary the thin but hard dorsal
crustaceous shell would protect them from the attacks of
their enemies. "The Trilobites, probably, like the Chitones,
adhered in masses one upon another, and thus formed those
conglomerations of individuals which are so remarkable in
certain rocks; but it is not likely that they were parasitical,
since almost all the existing parasites that adhere to other
animals, have strong feet, armed at their extremities with
hooks for that purpose."<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> From the form of the <i>labrum</i> of
the mouth (<i>Barrande</i>, pl. i. and ii A) it is inferred that they
were carnivorous, preying on naked mollusks, or on the
annelides, with which their remains are associated.</p>

<p>As the compound eyes of the <i>Trilobites</i><a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> are similar to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542"> 542 </a></span>
those of existing crustaceans and insects (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 792),
the highly interesting and important fact is established, that
the mutual relations of light to the eye, and of the eye to
light, were the same in the remote epoch when the Trilobites
flourished, as at the present time; and that the condition
of the waters of the sea, and the atmosphere, and the
relation of both these media to light, have undergone no
change through the countless ages that have elapsed since
the deposition of the Silurian strata.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Distribution of Fossil Crustaceans.</span> We
have seen that the Tertiary strata contain the remains of
many of the highest organized crustaceans; a few brachyurous,
macrurous, and entomostracous genera appear in the
Cretaceous, Oolitic, and Liassic formations; whilst the Isopodous
<i>Arch&aelig;oniscus</i> and several species of Cypris occur in
the Wealden and Purbeck deposits. Some few Entomostraca
have been enumerated from the Trias and Permian.</p>

<p>One species of macrurous decapod has been found in the
Muschelkalk of Germany; and Mr. Prestwich&#8217;s "Apus dubius"
(<i>Geol. Trans.</i> 2d ser. vol. v. pl. xli. <i>fig.</i> 9), and Dr. Ick&#8217;s
crustacean, noticed in <i>Journ. Geol. Soc.</i> vol. i. p. 199, both
from the Coal Measures of England, are probably true Decapodous
Crustaceans. With these exceptions not a species
of the numerous tribes of Crabs, Lobsters, &amp;c. has been observed
in the older formations, though composed of such
enormous thicknesses of marine detritus, and containing
countless myriads of the relics of the inhabitants of the
ocean.</p>

<p>A few species of <i>Limulus</i>, several <i>Cytheres</i> and allied
genera, and a few Trilobites (<i>Phillipsia</i> and <i>Griffithides</i>)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543"> 543 </a></span>
belong to the strata of the Carboniferous System. In the
Devonian System we find some minute entomostracans, the
gigantic <i>Pterygotus</i>, and various Trilobites (<i>Brontes</i>, <i>Cheirurus</i>,
<i>Homalonotus</i>, <i>Phacops</i>, &amp;c.); but it is the Silurian
rocks that constitute the grand mausoleum of those ancient
beings, the Trilobites.</p>

<p>There are about thirty genera of Trilobites found in the
Silurian rocks of Great Britain and Ireland. Many of
these are common to the Upper and Lower Divisions of
that system; and some of them are met with both in the
Silurian and in the Devonian rocks, as <i>Phacops</i>, <i>Brontes</i>,
<i>Cheirurus</i>, <i>Harpes</i>, and <i>Homalonotus</i>. The <i>Calymene Blumenbachii</i>
(<a href="#lign_175"><i>Lign.</i> 175</a>, <i>figs.</i> 3 and 4) ranges through the
Ludlow and Wenlock, to the Bala and Llandeilo formations.
The <i>Phacops caudatus</i> also (<a href="#lign_177"><i>Lign.</i> 177</a>), the <i>Cheirurus bimucronatus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
and the <i>Encrinurus punctatus</i><a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> extend from the
Ludlow, to the Llandeilo formation. The Upper Silurian
rocks exclusively contain some peculiar forms, as <i>Encrinurus
variolaris</i>, <i>Bumastus Barriensis</i>, and several species of <i>Acidaspis</i>.
And the Lower Silurian has several distinct genera,
namely, the <i>Trinucleus</i> (<a href="#lign_175"><i>Lign.</i> 175</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2), <i>Ogygia</i>, <i>Agnostus</i>,
<i>Asaphus</i>, <i>Olenus</i>, <i>Remopleurides</i>, &amp;c. One species of
<i>Pterygotus</i>, and one of <i>Eurypterus</i>, the <i>Ceratiocaris</i> and
<i>Hymenocaris</i>, and several species of the minute bivalved
Entomostraca (<i>Leperditia</i> and <i>Beyrichia</i>) are all that remain
to be enumerated as constituting, in company with the <i>Trilobites</i>,
the Crustacean fauna of the ancient Cambrian and
Silurian seas.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

fossil foot-tracks lately brought to England by W. E. Logan, Esq.,
and obtained by that gentleman from the Potsdam Sandstone (Lower
Silurian) of Eastern Canada. These foot-marks and trails have been
determined by Prof. Owen as being most probably referable to some
large Crustaceans of the <i>Limulus</i> Group, and are named by him <i>Protichnites</i>.

the Geological Society, vol. viii.)</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544"> 544 </a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">On Collecting Fossil Crustaceans.</span>&mdash;The Crabs and
Lobsters of the argillaceous tertiary strata are generally
imbedded in nodules of indurated clay and septaria. On
the shore beneath the cliffs on the north of the Isle of
Sheppey, and near Southend, specimens may be observed
in the nodules that have been exposed to the action
of the waves, the attrition to which they have been subjected
having partially worn away the surrounding stone,
and displayed the enclosed fossils. In these examples the
carapace is occasionally seen on one side, and the pair of
pincer-claws on the other face of the boulder; the other
feet and the plates of the thorax may sometimes be developed
in such examples by chiselling away the enveloping
mass. In the laminated marls of the tertiary and other
deposits, in which the minute crustaceans, as the <i>Cyprides</i>
abound, thin slabs covered with these relics may be easily
extracted; and many of the tertiary clays and sands yield
<i>Cytheres</i>, together with <i>Foraminifera</i> and other minute fossils,
on careful washing and examination with a lens.</p>

<p>The Chalk crustaceans, particularly those which are muricated,
or beset with spines and tubercles, as the <i>Enoploclytia
Sussexiensis</i> and <i>E. Leachii</i> (<a href="#lign_169"><i>Lign.</i> 169</a>), require considerable
patience and dexterity to develope successfully. The
crustaceous covering of the carapace and claws adheres
firmly to the chalk by the rough external coat, while the
inner, smooth, glossy surface as readily separates. Hence,
upon breaking a block of chalk containing portions of these
crustaceans, we find one piece exhibiting a chalk cast of the
claw or carapace, covered with tubercles or papill&aelig;, that
have been moulded in the bases of the spines of the crust;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545"> 545 </a></span>
and on the other portion the crustaceous shell imbedded by
its outer surface, and presenting the internal glossy lining,
beset with circular depressions, which are the bases of the
spines. This crust is exceedingly friable, and will flake off
by a very slight touch. To obtain specimens with the external
characters, it is necessary to proceed with great caution;
and when indications of a crustacean are observed in
a block, the chalk should be chiselled or sawn off to within
half an inch of the surface of the fossil, and the remainder
of the stone be cleared away, piece by piece, by means of a
penknife or graver. By this process the fossils figured <i>Foss.
South D.</i> pl. xxix. xxx. xxxi. were developed. When a fine
specimen has been broken, and the shell is attached to one
piece of the stone and the cast to the other, it is possible to
obtain an illustrative example of the external surface, by
cementing the pieces accurately together with very thin hot
glue; and, when firmly consolidated, the chalk may be removed,
and the spines, tubercles, and papill&aelig; of the crustaceous
covering be developed by the method previously
described. A thin coating of mastic varnish will give durability
to the crust, and improve its appearance; but the
rich brown colour it possesses when first exposed soon disappears.
The Crustaceans of the Galt are often found
amongst the argillaceous and pyritous nodules flung aside in
heaps where the Galt is used for brick-making.</p>

<p>The <i>Cytherid&aelig;</i> of the Chalk, Galt, Oolite, &amp;c. are to be
obtained by disintegrating the matrix in water, and examining
the debris, after sifting, under a lens.</p>

<p>The Limuli of the Coal-measures often form the nuclei of
clay nodules, as in the example figured <a href="#lign_172"><i>Lign.</i> 172</a>, in which
<i>fig.</i> 2 represents the nodule without any external indication
of its contents, and <i>figs.</i> 1, and 3, the same broken, and displaying
the crustacean. Traces of the legs, branchi&aelig;, and
other appendages, should be diligently sought for in fossils
of this kind, for they are more likely to be detected in such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546"> 546 </a></span>
specimens than in those found in limestone. It is possible
that polished sections of the coiled up examples of Trilobites
(<a href="#lign_175"><i>Lign.</i> 175</a>, <i>fig.</i> 4) would throw some light upon the nature
of the hitherto undiscovered organs of locomotion and respiration
of this extinct order of Crustaceans.</p>

<p class="caption2"><a id="Arachnida"></a>FOSSIL INSECTS, SCORPIONS, AND SPIDERS.</p>

<p>From the Crustaceans we pass by a natural transition to
the other Articulata, viz. the <span class="smcap">Arachnida</span> (Scorpions and
Spiders) and the <span class="smcap">Insecta</span>, in the last of which "the highest
problem of animal mechanics is solved, and the body and
its appendages can be lifted from the ground and propelled
through the air" (<i>Owen</i>). The skeleton in these animals,
as in the Crustaceans, is chiefly external, and consists of a
hard shell or case (composed of a peculiar substance, termed
<i>chitine</i>), divided into segments, and furnished with articulated
or jointed hollow extremities. The head is distinct,
and has a pair of compound eyes, and of jointed antenn&aelig;.
To the segments that form the thorax the legs are attached,
and these consist of three pieces in the hexapods (insects
with six feet), each supporting a pair of feet. The wings in
the flying insects are attached to the middle and third
thoracic segments. The legs, or articulated appendages, are
hollow, as in the Crustaceans, and contain the muscles
and other soft parts. The generic and other distinctions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548"> 548 </a></span>
adopted by naturalists, to facilitate the study of this most
numerous division of the animal kingdom, are founded on
the structure and configuration of the antenn&aelig; and wings.
The latter consist of flat membranous expansions, supported
by hollow tubes or nervures; and in some orders
consist of one pair, and in others of two. In burrowing
insects, as the Beetle, the front pair of wings constitutes a
hard case (<i>elytron</i>), which covers and protects the membranous
posterior pair, when the animal is in repose or
walking. The modifications of the wings furnish the characters
by which the class is divided into orders. Thus the
<i>Coleoptera</i> (sheathed-wings) comprise the beetles and other
burrowing insects, in which the membranous wings are
folded transversely beneath the elytra, or wing-cases. The
<i>Orthoptera</i> (straight-wings), those with two pairs of wings,
of which the anterior encase the others, the posterior being
membranous, and folded longitudinal during repose; as
the Earwig, Cockroach, Mantis, and Locusts. <i>Neuroptera</i>
(nerved-wings), those with two pairs of transparent reticulated
wings, as the Libellula, or Dragon-fly, the Ephemera,
and the Termites. <i>Hymenoptera</i> (membranous-wings),
with simply veined membranous wings, as the Gall-flies, the
Bee, &amp;c. The Cicas, Aphis, and Coccus constitute the
somewhat anomalous group termed <i>Homoptera</i> (equal-wings),
in which the anterior pair of wings are usually
similar to the posterior in consistence, and shut up in a
roof-like manner. The <i>Heteroptera</i> (different-wings) include
the Nepa, Notonecta, &amp;c. and have the anterior wings
coriaceous at the base, membranous towards the point, and
shutting up nearly horizontally, partly lapping over one
another. <i>Lepidoptera</i> (scaly-wings) have wings covered
with scales, as the Butterfly and Moth. In the <i>Diptera</i>
(two-wings) the anterior pair of wings only are the instruments
for flying, and the hinder pair are reduced to mere
clavate appendages, as the Gnat and Fly. The Phrygane&aelig;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549"> 549 </a></span>
(Caddis flies) constitute the order of <i>Trichoptera</i> (hairy-wings),
related to the Neuroptera, but resembling the
Lepidoptera in the distribution of the nervures of the
wings, and in many other characters. Lastly, there remain
the Wingless Insects, divisible into three orders, of which
the Flea, the Parasites, and the Podura are respectively the
types. With these few remarks on those durable parts of
the structure of Insects which their fossil remains generally
present, we must quit this part of the subject, and enter
upon the examination of the relics which are the immediate
objects of our present inquiry.</p>

<p>From the enduring nature of the elytra, segments, and
articulated extremities of insects, the fossil remains of
animals of this class might naturally be expected to abound
in lacustrine and fluviatile deposits; this, however, is not
the case, and except in a few favoured localities, fossil insects
are seldom met with, and good specimens rank among the
most rare and interesting of the organic remains of the
Secondary formations. In certain Tertiary beds, as at
&#338;ningen, and Aix in Provence, insects of numerous species
and genera have been discovered; and the cream-coloured
limestone of Solenhofen, among its numerous other treasures,
has yielded some fine examples of this class. The strata
in which remains of insects have been found in England<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a>
are the Tertiary clays of the Bagshot series, the Hastings
beds, Purbeck marls and limestones, Kimmeridge Clay,
Oxford Clay, Forest Marble, Stonesfield Slate, Upper and
Lower Lias, and the Coal Measures.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_495" id="Footnote_495"></a><a href="#FNanchor_495"><span class="label">[495]</span></a> Pal&aelig;ontologists are particularly indebted to the Rev. P. B.
Brodie, F.G.S. for his compendious and valuable "History of the
Fossil Insects in the Secondary Rocks of England" (8vo. 1845); and
to J. O. Westwood, Esq. the eminent Entomologist, for the very
important and interesting Observations on the Insect Remains, prefixed
to the above work. In an interesting paper on the Geology of
the vicinity of Ilminster, C. Moore, Esq. has noticed the numerous
Insect remains of the Upper Lias of that place. Prof. E. Forbes and
W. R. Binfield, Esq. have discovered Insects in the Hastings series;
and Mr. Binfield, besides having most successfully searched the Upper
Lias of Gloucestershire, has also detected some specimens in the Lias
at Lyme. Lastly, Mr. Morris has found Insects in the Upper Lias in
Lincolnshire.</p>

<p class="caption3">ARACHNIDA.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Scorpion.</span> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xlvi&#8242;.)&mdash;The discover of a
fossil Scorpion in coal-shale, associated with leaves, by Count
Sternberg, and of Spiders in the limestone of Solenhofen,
by Count M&uuml;nster, proves the existence at a very remote
period of both these insectivorous families of <i>Arachnidans</i>,
or spiders (<i>Bd.</i> p. 405). The fossil Scorpion was found in
a block of argillaceous shale, at Chomle, in Bohemia.
It lies imbedded amidst the carbonized remains of leaves,
and a large trifid carpolithe or seed-vessel (see <i>Bd.</i> pl.
xlvi&#8242;.): by a fortunate separation of the shale, the back or
dorsal carapace is shown on one surface; and the thorax,
with five or six legs attached, and the abdominal segments,
are exposed on the other, together with a fragment of the
tail of another and larger Scorpion. The head and eyes,
one of the jaws with teeth, and a portion of the skin remain
(<i>Bd.</i> pl. xlvi. figs. 3, 4, 5, 6). The horny covering seems to
have undergone no change; it is still elastic and transient,
and consists of two layers, both retaining their
texture, and structure, and exhibiting under the microscope
hexagonal cells divided by strong partitions.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Spiders.</span>&mdash;With the numerous insects preserved
in the gypseous marls at Aix, of which we shall treat hereafter,
Spiders are occasionally found. A beautiful example,
showing the under surface of a small spider, with the papill&aelig;
of the spinning organs protruded by pressure, from the
cabinet of Mrs. Murchison, is figured, <i>Bd.</i> pl. xlvi&#8242;. fig 12
In the beautiful lithographic stone of Solenhofen the remains
of spiders are not unfrequent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Neuroptera.</span>&mdash;Of this order, the insects of which
are distinguished by their four finely reticulated membranous
wings, several fossil species have been found.
Some of these are referable to the family Libellulid&aelig;;&mdash;insects
so well known from their light and elegant figure, their
beautiful and variegated colours, their large lustrous wings,
and the velocity and gracefulness of their motions.</p>

pairs of wings remain, but one wing is pressed down beneath
the abdomen: the nervures of the wings are admirably
preserved.</p>

<p>A few examples of the remains of this family have been
found in the British strata. One species of <i>Libellula</i> and
one of <i>&AElig;shna</i> have been found by the Rev. Mr. Brodie in
the Purbeck beds of the Vale of Wardour. Two species of

have been obtained by Messrs. Strickland, Buckman, Binfield,
and Brodie from the Lias. The wing of the <i>&AElig;shna liassina</i>,
discovered in the Lias, near Binton, in Warwickshire, by
Mr. Strickland, is two inches and ten and a half lines in
length, and eight and a half lines in its greatest breadth,
being one-third larger than the wing of the largest British
species. See <i>Wond.</i> <i>Lign.</i> 119, and p. 528.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Coleoptera.</span>&mdash;The <i>elytra</i> or wing-cases of coleopterous
insects have long since been noticed in the oolitic
slate at Stonesfield, near Oxford; a locality celebrated for
the only mammalian relies hitherto discovered in the Secondly
strata of England. The Stonesfield elytra are always
found detached; in no instance, I believe, has any other
part of an insect been observed, except a single leg of a
<i>Curculio</i> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xlvi&#8242;. <i>fig.</i> 10). The specimen figured <a href="#lign_181"><i>Lign.</i> 181</a>,
 <i>fig.</i> 1, displays the usual characters of the largest
species. These fossils are of a reddish-brown colour, with
a finely granulated surface; there appear to be four or five
species, all of which belong to <i>Buprestis</i>, a family of beetles
remarkable for their splendid metallic lustre. Remains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555"> 555 </a></span>
<i>Coleoptera</i> occur in the Tertiary clays near Corfe, Dorset,<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a>
and in the Lias of Worcestershire and Gloucestershire; and
in the Danby oolitic coal-pits, in the eastern moorlands of
Yorkshire, the elytra of beetles have also been discovered,
by Mr. R. C. Taylor (<i>Bd.</i> vol. ii. p. 78).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_498" id="Footnote_498"></a><a href="#FNanchor_498"><span class="label">[498]</span></a> See Notice by the Rev. Mr. Brodie, Quart. Geol. Journ. vol. ix.
p. 51.</p></div>

<p>A most remarkable fossil of this kind is described by Dr.
Buckland; a unique specimen of <i>Buprestis</i>, from Japan,
about an inch long, <i>converted into chalcedony</i>, with the antenn&aelig;
and portions of the legs finely preserved. The surface
of this insect is covered with clusters of minute
concentric rings of chalcedony; an appearance common in
silicified shells. Associated with this fossil, were fragments
of silicified wood, bored with tubular cavities, apparently
by the larv&aelig; of insects of this family; and within these
cavities was a quantity of dust produced by the boring, also
converted into chalcedony (<i>Bd.</i> vol. ii. p. 78).</p>


<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Curculio</span>, a genus of coleoptera distinguished by
their splendid elytra, of which the <i>Diamond Beetle</i> is a
familiar example, the remains of two species have been discovered
in the nodular ironstone of Coalbrook Dale, by Mr.
W. Anstice, and are figured and described by Dr. Buckland
(<i>Bd.</i> vol. ii. p. 76; and pl. xlvi&#8242;. figs. 1, 2). In one of these
specimens (<i>Curculioides Ansticii</i>), with the exception of the
rostrum and anterior part of the head, all the essential characters
of the insect are displayed; namely, the elytra,
thorax, and six legs, the hindmost of which exhibits the
enlarged femur, or thigh, a character peculiar to the <i>Curculionid&aelig;</i>.
The legs possess a tufted appearance, which that
eminent entomologist, Mr. Curtis, conceives may have been
caused by fungi, after the death of the animal, as often happens
in tropical climates. In the other example (<i>C. Prestvichii</i>),
the insect lies on its back, with the left side raised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556"> 556 </a></span>
upwards, and exhibiting a portion of the external surface of
the left elytron; there are remains of the antenn&aelig;, and indications
of the proboscis and of the legs.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557"> 557 </a></span>
discovered the remains of several orders of insects, and
states that, for abundance and variety of specimens, the
beds may be said to resemble the Tertiary marls of Aix and
&#338;ningen. These remains were obtained from a quarry at
Dinton, about twelve miles west of Salisbury. They consist
chiefly of <i>Coleoptera</i>, with the remains of <i>Neuroptera</i>,
<i>Trichoptera</i>, and <i>Homoptera</i>, and of several species of <i>Diptera</i>.
In the cream-coloured laminated Purbeck marls that
axe exposed in Durlstone Bay (about one mile from Swanage)
insectiferous beds have been found by the Rev. O.
Fisher and Prof. E. Forbes, which are the equivalents of
those of the Vale of Wardour; and similar beds were met
with in the cutting of the railway through the Ridgway
Hill, between Dorchester and Weymouth.</p>

<p>In a quarry on the road-side between the village of Stone

Purbeck marls; in these latter remains of Insects occur,
together with scales and teeth of small Fishes, and abundance
of <i>Cyprides</i>.</p>

<p>All the British localities of fossil insects have now been
alluded to; but on the Continent, independently of the

been made, <a href="#Page_550">p. 550</a>, there are several tertiary deposits exceedingly
rich in these interesting fossils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Insects of Aix, in Provence.</span>&mdash;The town of Aix
is situated in the lowest part of a deep valley, the immediate
flanks of which are composed of a thick fresh-water
formation, lying unconformably upon strata of Jura limestone.
The fresh-water series consists of white and grey
calcareous marls, calcareo-siliceous grits, and beds of gypsum;
and the quarries formed in the latter rock have long
been celebrated for the prodigious quantity of fish and
plants which they contain. M. Marcel de Serres first made
known the great abundance of insects in these gypseous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558"> 558 </a></span>
marls, and has enumerated nearly seventy genera, chiefly of
the Coleoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera; they are mostly
referable to European forms, and to existing genera. An
interesting Memoir on these strata, by Sir R. Murchison and
Sir C. Lyell,<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> first directed the attention of the English
reader to these beautiful fossils. In <i>Wond.</i> p. 261, an epitome
of this valuable communication is given, and five
specimens of insects are here figured, which will convey some
idea of their forms and perfect state of preservation.</p>

frequent marshy plants of the same kind as those which are
found associated with the insects; and it seems probable
that they fell into the lake from the plants which grew on
its borders, and became enveloped in the fine mud or sediment.
Numerous species of several genera of Ants also occur
in these deposits of &#338;ningen and at Radoboj in Croatia.<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">FOSSIL CADDIS-WORM.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Larv&aelig; of Phryganea.</span> <i>Ly.</i> p. 185.&mdash;The <i>Caddis-worm</i>,
so well known to all the brethren of the angle, is the
larva of the winged insect termed <i>Phryganea</i>, and is abundant
at the bottom of fresh-water streams and lakes; the
cases, like those of the marine <i>Sabella</i> (<a href="#Page_385">p. 385</a>, <i>fig.</i> 6), are
always studded over with extraneous bodies, cemented together
by a glutinous secretion to the silken integument, or
case, which encloses the lava. Some species are coated with
pieces of stick or straw, others with minute shells, as planorbis,
bithinia, and the like; and when the larv&aelig; have
passed into the perfect state, their cases, or <i>indusi&aelig;</i>, remain.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560"> 560 </a></span>
Many of the Tertiary fresh-water limestones of Auvergne
are almost wholly composed of the <i>indusi&aelig;</i> of Caddis-worms,
cemented together by calcareo-siliceous matter into stone,
which is employed for building, and is called indusial limestone
(<i>Wond.</i> p. 273). These limestones are associated with
marls abounding in fresh-water shells and cyprides; the
whole assemblage presenting all the stratigraphical and zoological
characters of a lacustrine formation. "If," says
Mr. Scrope,<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> "we consider that repeated strata, of five or
six feet in thickness, almost entirely composed of these
tubes, once extended over a district presenting a surface of
many hundred square miles, we may have some idea of the
countless myriads of minute beings which lived and died
within the bosom of that ancient lake."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On Collecting Fossil Insects.</span>&mdash;The localities in which
the British collector may reasonably expect to discover fossil
remains of Insects, are Stonesfield, where the elytra of
beetles are by no means scarce,&mdash;Coalbrook Dale, in which
relics of this class are sometimes, but very rarely, found in
the ironstone nodules,&mdash;Bedford, Warwickshire, and the
Wainlode and Aust Cliffs, for Lower Lias insects,&mdash;Dumbleton
and Ilminster, for Upper Lias insects,&mdash;Dallards, near
Dinton, and Stone, near Aylesbury, and the exposures of
similar beds in Dorsetshire, for the Purbeck insects.</p>

<p>The white clays belonging to the Bagshot series of
Bournemouth, Poole, and Corfe, so rich in beautifully preserved
leaves and other parts of plants, should be carefully
searched for insect remains, since these clays at Creech,
near Corfe, have already afforded a few specimens.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>At page 549 a few other English localities yielding these
delicate and very interesting fossils are also indicated as
having been lately discovered by some of our most acute

<p>Should the student visit the celebrated sites of these
fossils in France and Germany, namely, Aix, &#338;ningen, Solenhofen,
&amp;c., he will have but little difficulty in obtaining
an interesting series, at a moderate expense.</p>

<p>The marls and limestones in which insects occur are often
of a laminated character, and in general readily split asunder
in the direction favourable for the display of the insects.
In some examples, only the form of the animal is seen
through a thin opaque pellicle of calcareous earth, which
may be removed by a penknife or graver, and the wings,
elytra, antenn&aelig;, legs, &amp;c. will thus be disclosed. A very
thin coating of mastic varnish heightens the colours of such
specimens, and renders them more durable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ascending</span> from the two grand subdivisions of the animal
kingdom, the <i>Mollusca</i> and the <i>Articulata</i>, we advance to
the <span class="smcap">Vertebrata</span>, animals distinguished from all those which
have previously engaged our attention, by the possession of
a bony, jointed, hollow column of support, or spine, formed
of bones termed <i>vertebr&aelig;</i> (<i>turn or whirl bones</i>), and enclosing
and protecting those strands or cords of the nervous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563"> 563 </a></span>
system called the spinal marrow; the former classes, being
destitute of such a structure, have the general name of
<i>Invertebrata</i>.</p>

<p>In the beings whose mineralized remains form the subject
of our present investigation, the durable parts of the frame-work,
or skeleton, are, in most instances, situated internally,
and their fossil relics consist principally of the bones, or
solid earthy portions of their structures, either imbedded in
the rocks in their natural relative position, or in a state of
dismemberment and dispersion. In most cases the teeth,
and in many the durable parts of their external integument,
or skin, are also preserved, in a greater or less degree
of integrity.</p>

<p>In the lowest class of <i>vertebrata</i>, the <span class="smcap">Fishes</span>, the skin is
covered with numerous pieces or scales, of a dense, durable
substance, and strengthened, in some families, by the addition
of osseous plates; thus constituting a flexible and
almost impenetrable coat of armour, which affords suitable
protection to beings peculiarly exposed to external injuries,
from the nature of the regions they inhabit, and the state
of warfare with each other in which they are constantly
engaged. Confined to a fluid medium, they are provided
with organs fitted for aquatic respiration, called <i>branchi&aelig;</i>,
or gills, and with instruments of progressive motion, termed
<i>fins</i>, by which they are enabled to propel themselves through
the water with great velocity. The apparatus for seizing,
tearing, and crushing their prey presents numerous and important
modifications, corresponding to the habits and economy
of the different genera; their teeth offering as great
variety of form and structure as those of the higher orders
of animals.</p>

<p>The cartilaginous or the osseous nature of the skeleton,
and the number and position of the fins, were the characters
formerly employed in the classification of Fishes; but Prof.
Agassiz, conceiving the structure of the skin to afford a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564"> 564 </a></span>
natural index to the essential modifications of organization
and functions, has, with great sagacity, adopted an arrangement
founded upon the form and structure of the scales;
and he has divided the whole class into four orders, each
distinguished by essential differences in the dermal (skin)
system. To the geologist this method has proved of inestimable
value; for it is simple, easy of application, and, so
far as our present knowledge extends, may be relied upon as
affording accurate conclusions as to the nature and relations
of the originals to which a few detached fossil scales may
have belonged. Another important aid has been derived
from the microscopical examination of the structure of the
teeth; and a splendid work on this subject by Professor
Owen has opened a wide field of pal&aelig;ontological investigation,
which is yet but very partially explored.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<p>The living species of Fishes exceed eight thousand; and
those found in a fossil state, and determined by M. Agassiz,
already amount to upwards of one thousand five hundred;
while several hundreds are still undescribed; and the rapid
progress of geological research is continually adding to the
number: upwards of six hundred British fossil species are
enumerated. In an initiatory work like the present, it will
be necessary to confine our remarks to an illustration of the
mode in which the investigation of the fossil remains of the
animals of this class should be conducted; and, by the
elucidation of a few leading principles, prepare the student
for the perusal of works expressly devoted to this branch
of Pal&aelig;ontology.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_506" id="Footnote_506"></a><a href="#FNanchor_506"><span class="label">[506]</span></a> The admirable and important work entitled "<i>Recherches sur les
Poissons Fossiles, par Louis Agassiz</i>," stands preeminent in this department
of science. It consists of five volumes, 4to. of letter-press,
and five volumes, folio, of coloured plates. It must be consulted by
all who would acquire a correct view of the present state of fossil
Ichthyology. <i>It is from this work that the commentary in the text has
been chiefly derived.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565"> 565 </a></span></p></div>

<p>The fossil remains of fishes rank in the first class of the
"Medals of Creation," for they demonstrate the existence of
numerous tribes of highly organized beings in some of the
most ancient fossiliferous strata, and the continuance of the
same type of organization, variously modified, through the
entire series of subsequent deposits to the present time.
Each geological formation contains peculiar groups of fossil
fishes, distinguished by distinct modifications of structure.
Thus, according to the data at present obtained, all the
osseous fishes anterior to the Chalk belong to genera which
have no representatives among existing species; and they
are characterised by rhomboidal scales covered with enamel.</p>

<p>The state of conservation in which the fossils of this class
occur, appears to have depended on the relative delicacy or
firmness of the original structures, and on the nature of the
deposits in which the fishes were imbedded. Thus the fossil
fishes of the early formations, which are characterised by
their dense integument and enamelled scales, often present
the entire forms of the originals, and generally considerable
portions of the connected scales, with the fins and other
appendages: while the specimens of later deposits, which
contain a large proportion of species with delicate scales,
more often display the mineralized osseous skeleton, than
the dermal structure. Sedimentary strata composed of mud
or fine detritus, of whatever age, have been most favourable
to the preservation of the entire forms; hence we often find
in the pulverulent clays and marls of the Tertiary strata, in
the Chalk of England and Westphalia, and in the fine lithographic
stone of Solenhofen, fishes perfect in form, and not
only individuals, but groups, with the scales, fins, head,
teeth, and even the capsule of the eye, in their natural
positions. A small slab of marl from Aix, in Provence, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566"> 566 </a></span>
the collection of Sir R. I. Murchison, contains scores of
small fishes, as perfect as if recently imbedded in soft
mud: a portion of this specimen is represented, <a href="#lign_184"><i>Lign.</i> 184</a>;
and the beautiful fish figured in the frontispiece of vol. i.
(pl. i. <i>fig.</i> 3), from near Castellamare, will serve to illustrate
the state of perfection of some of the ichthyolites of the
Jura limestone. In the Chalk, many of the fishes are uncompressed,
the body being as perfect in form as if the
original had been surrounded by soft plaster of Paris while
floating in the water. But in coarse limestones and conglomerates,&mdash;in
other words, in materials that have been subjected
to the action of the waves and torrents,&mdash;detached
teeth, scales, bones, &amp;c. constitute the principal vestiges of
this class of beings.</p>

<p>In illustration of this department of Paleontology, it
will be expedient to consider,&mdash;1stly, the characters afforded
by the scales and dermal appendages; 2dly, the teeth, or
dental organs; 3dly, the osseous and cartilaginous skeletons;
and lastly, apply the data thus obtained to the elucidation
of some of the principal fossil genera and species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scales of Fishes.</span>&mdash;The dermal plates or scales are composed
of two substances, disposed in lamin&aelig; or plates; the
one cartilaginous or horny,&mdash;the other dense and osseous,
possessing the structure of bone. In most species the scales
are imbricated, <i>i. e.</i> lie over each other like the tiles of a
roof; the margin of a front row partly covering the series
immediately behind. From this arrangement, the apparent
shape of the scales is very different from their true form;
the processes of attachment and the lateral angles being
concealed. The scales that are not imbricated are either
very small, and imbedded in the substance of the skin so as
to be imperceptible to the naked eye, as in the shagreen of
Sharks; or are disposed in the form of bosses or scutcheons,
as in the Rays; sometimes bristling equally over the surface
of the body, as in the <i>Diodon</i>; and sometimes covering it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567"> 567 </a></span>
like mosaic work; or forming particular series on certain
regions of the body, while the other parts are garnished
with different scales, as in the Sturgeon. There are a few
genera destitute of scales. In almost all fishes there is a
particular series disposed in a gently undulated line along
each side of the body, from the head to the tail, and constituting
what is termed the lateral line; these scales are
tubular, and serve an important purpose in the economy of
these animals. Every one must be aware that the body in
most living fishes is constantly covered with a kind of
mucus, or slime, which serves to lubricate the skin and to
defend it from the action of the surrounding medium. This
fluid is secreted by a mucous canal or duct, which extends
along the body, and ramifies in all the bones of the head,
jaws, &amp;c.; and it is distributed over the surface of the head
by numerous pores in the bones, and over the body by the
tubes formed by the row of scales above described.</p>

of plates, which are toothed or pectinated on their posterior margin

so that the lowermost always extend beyond the uppermost, their
numerous sharp points or teeth render the scales very harsh to the

The scales of the lateral line consist of funnels placed one
within the other; the contracted part of which, applied against the
disk of the scale, forms the tube through which the mucus flows.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569"> 569 </a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fins of Fishes.</span>&mdash;As the progression of fishes through
the water is principally effected by the action of the tail,
they have no limbs commonly so called. The instruments for
balancing the body, and for assisting progression, are the
fins, which are composed of numerous rays that support a
membranous expansion; and the number and situation of
the fins present various modifications in the different orders
and genera.</p>

<p>The fins are named according to the situation they occupy;
for example, <i>pectoral</i>, those on each side of the chest,
and which correspond to the anterior extremities of other
vertebrated animals; <i>dorsal</i>, on the back; <i>ventral</i>, on the
belly; <i>caudal</i>, on the tail. (See outlines of Fish, <i>Ligns.</i> <a href="#lign_186">186</a>,
<a href="#lign_187">187</a>, <a href="#lign_195">195</a>.) The rays are of two kinds; 1st, the <i>Spinous</i>
rays; these consist of a single osseous piece, usually dense
and pointed, sometimes flexible and elastic, and divided longitudinally
(<i>Ligns.</i> <a href="#lign_188">188</a>, <a href="#lign_196">196</a>); 2d, <i>Soft</i> or <i>articulated</i> rays,
which are composed of numerous small articulations or
joints, and divide into branches at their extremities. Many
species of fishes have four fins; others six; some but two;
and in certain genera they are altogether wanting. In a
fossil state the fins are often beautifully preserved; even the
soft rays in many of the Tertiary marls and in the Chalk,
are found entire, and attached to the body in their natural
situation. The large, strong, spinous rays of the dorsal fins
of the cartilaginous fishes, as the <i>Sharks</i> and <i>Rays</i>, are generally
found detached, or connected only with a few vertebr&aelig;;
but they are so abundant in some of the Secondary deposits
(and in numerous instances they are the only vestiges of extinct
species and genera), that they possess great geological
interest; they are distinguished by the term <i>Ichthyodorulites</i>
(<i>fossil fish-weapons</i>), under which head they will hereafter
be described (see <a href="#lign_188"><i>Lign.</i> 188</a>). The first ray in the
dorsal fin of some fishes is protected in front by a double
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570"> 570 </a></span>
row of enamelled scales, and these often occur in a fossil
state (see <a href="#lign_196"><i>Lign.</i> 196</a>, <i>fig.</i> 5).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth of Fishes.</span>&mdash;Of all the durable parts of animals
teeth occur in the mineral kingdom, the teeth of fishes
present by far the most numerous, varied, and striking modifications
of form, structure, composition, mode of arrangement,
and attachment; and yet these dental organs,
separately considered, do not in many instances, either in
their structure or mode of implantation, afford characters
by which the natural affinities of the original can be satisfactorily
ascertained; and without the aid of other parts of
the skeleton it is often impossible to determine, from external
characters only, whether an unknown form of tooth belonged
to an animal of the class of Fishes or of Reptiles.
Although the modifications of form are almost innumerable,
they are referable to four principal types; namely, the
conical, the flattened, the prismatic, and the cylindrical.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>The conical teeth are extremely variable in size and form;
some are slender, almost invisible points, distributed like the
pile of velvet (<i>villous-teeth</i>), or set like the hairs of a brush
(<i>brush-teeth</i>); some are long and slender, or barbed at the
point; others are obtuse; and many are long and striated
at the base, and closely resemble the teeth of certain reptiles.

have the grinding surface smooth; others, deeply grooved;
in some it is flat; in others convex. In form they are
either lozenge-shaped, elliptical, square, oblong, semilunar,
&amp;c. The cylindrical teeth are hemispherical, or flattened;
in some fishes they are short and thick; in others slender
and support an obtuse, conical crown. The prismatic form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571"> 571 </a></span>
is equally modified; from the compressed, sharp, lanceolate,
cutting teeth, to the strong, triangular, three-pointed dentary

<p>The mode of arrangement and attachment of the teeth, is
as diversified as their forms. In some species all the teeth
are of one type, and disposed in somewhat of a serial order
on both sides of the jaws; but in a large proportion of fishes
there are several kinds of teeth, which are implanted not
only in the jaws, properly so called, but on the bones which
form the cavity of the mouth, the arches of the palate,
tongue, &amp;c.; and it is peculiar to this class of vertebrata
to present examples of teeth developed in the median
line (<i>along the middle</i>) of the mouth, as in certain species
of Rays; or crossing the symphysis (the <i>front line of union</i>
of the two sides) of the lower jaw, as in <i>Myliobates</i><a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> (see
<a href="#lign_194"><i>Lign.</i> 194</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2). In some species the teeth are implanted
in sockets, to which they are attached only by the soft parts,
as in the rostral teeth of the <i>Saw-fish</i>; some have hollow
bases, supported upon bony prominences, which rise from
the base of the socket; as in several fossil teeth from the
Chalk. "But by far the most common mode of attachment
is by a continuous ossification between the dental pulp and
the jaw,"<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> the teeth being thus anchylosed to the bone. In
the Sharks the osseous bases of the teeth are attached by a
ligamentous substance to the tough, dense crust, which
covers the cartilaginous jaws; the teeth of these fishes are
therefore generally found detached in a fossil state, in consequence
of the decomposition of this substance.</p>

<p>The teeth are composed of a dense, osseous material, of a
finely tubular structure, termed <i>dentine</i>; which, in many
species, forms on the external surface of the tooth a layer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572"> 572 </a></span>
firmer texture, with a glossy surface, resembling enamel.
The essential character of their organization is to have a
pulp or medullary cavity, or cavities, filled with a plexus of
blood-vessels and nerves, from which the minute tubes composing
the dentine radiate.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> The differences observable in
the size, mode of ramification, and distribution of the medullary
cavities or canals, and the <i>calcigerous tubes</i>,<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> as
revealed by microscopic exploration, constitute important
distinctive characters; particularly in the examination of
the fossil teeth of extinct fishes. In some teeth the dentine
is traversed by equidistant, parallel, medullary canals; in
others, these channels frequently subdivide, and their
branches anastomose with each other. In some the medullary
canals form a reticulated, or net-like structure in the
dentine, the meshes of which are occupied by calcigerous
tubes, and cells; often producing a dendritical appearance,
as in the tooth of a fossil fish named <i>Dendrodus</i>. "In the
highest type of structure, the dentine consists of a simple
medullary cavity or canal, and a single system of calcigerous
tubes, which radiate from the central or sub-central
pulp-cavity, at right angles to the periphery of the tooth"
(<i>Owen</i>), as in the teeth of the extinct Sauroid (<i>lizard-like</i>)
fishes. A continued succession of teeth takes place during
the life of the fish, and we often find in fossil specimens a
series of successional teeth beneath the row in use; as in
the fragment of a jaw of <i>Lepidotus</i>, from Tilgate Forest
<a href="#lign_107"><i>Lign.</i> 107</a>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skeletons of Fishes.</span>&mdash;The skeletons of the animals of
this class differ so remarkably in their relative degree of
firmness and elasticity, in consequence of peculiar modifications
of their constituent substance, as to form two grand
divisions; one of which is termed the <i>osseous</i>, the other the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573"> 573 </a></span>
<i>cartilaginous</i>. The essential difference in the skeletons of
these two groups consists in the presence or absence of
earthy matter (<i>phosphate and carbonate of lime</i>) in the
materials of which they are constructed. In the cartilaginous
fishes, the skeleton is cartilaginous and transparent;
but in some species, the skin has dense osseous particles or
plates on the skin, as in the <i>Rays</i>; and in others, the head
and body are protected by large osseous scutcheons, as in
the <i>Sturgeon</i>. There is also an intermediate group of fishes,
termed the <i>fibro-cartilaginous</i>, in which the skeleton contains
lime, but in a much less proportion than in the true
osseous fishes. In some genera, certain portions of the skeleton,
as the bodies of the vertebra, are cartilaginous, while
the spinous processes, ribs, &amp;c. are osseous; these characters
are of considerable importance in the investigation of the
fossil remains of fishes, as we shall hereafter have occasion
to demonstrate.</p>

<p>The skeleton consists of the <i>cranium</i> or skull, which is
composed of numerous bones,&mdash;the jaws, and bones of the
tongue,&mdash;the osseous frame-work of the organs of respiration,
consisting of the bones, rays, and arches that support
the gills, and the <i>opercula</i>, or covers which close over the
branchial apertures,&mdash;and of the vertebral column, formed
of numerous dorsal and caudal vertebr&aelig;, with the ribs and
other appendages; there are no proper cervical vertebr&aelig;,
or spinal bones of the neck.</p>

<p>The branchial arches are in general four or five on each
side, and are attached above to the cranium, and below to
a chain of small bones, by which they are connected with
the <i>os hyoides</i>, or bone of the tongue. The opercular bones,
composing the cover or lid of the opening of the gills, consist
of three pieces on each side, and are distinguished by
the names, <i>opercular</i>, <i>pre-opercular</i>, and <i>sub-opercular</i>,
according to the situations which they respectively
occupy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574"> 574 </a></span></p>

<p>The <i>vertebr&aelig;</i> are double hollow cones,<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> not unlike an
hour-glass in form: the interval between two of these bones
is filled up, in the living state, by a gelatinous fluid. Along
the upper part of each vertebra, there is an annular cavity,
which in the united vertebral column forms a canal for the
spinal marrow; the posterior dorsal and caudal verteb&aelig;
have also a channel below, for the passage of the large
blood-vessels.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_514" id="Footnote_514"></a><a href="#FNanchor_514"><span class="label">[514]</span></a> There are certain exceptions; thus in the <i>Lepidosteus</i> the vertebral
column is a series of ball-and-socket joints, the convexity being
anterior, as in the land Salamander, and in the fossil reptile known
as the Streptospondylus.</p></div>

<p>There are likewise bones analogous to some of those which
enter into the composition of the extremities, chest or thorax,
and pelvis of the higher vertebrata; but which it is
not necessary for our present purpose here to describe.</p>

<p>Of the organs of vision some fossil remains also occur.
The sclerotic coat, or capsule of the eye, being bony in
fishes, is often preserved; and in several chalk specimens
I have found it occupying the orbit.</p>

<p>In addition to those durable parts of fishes, already mentioned,
as likely to be met with in a fossil state, the bones
called <i>otolithes</i> (ear-stones) must be enumerated. These
calcareous bodies are found in the membranous labyrinth of
the organs of hearing; and, although more or less developed
in the ear-bulb of all animals, they are larger and of
more definite forms in the higher osseous and cartilaginous
fishes. The <i>otolithes</i> are supposed to assist in communicating
more vivid impressions of sounds to the extremities of the
auditory nerves; they are stony in most aquatic animals,
and friable or pulverulent in those that live on land.
Smooth, oblong otolithes are not uncommon in the Crag
deposits of Norfolk and Suffolk; and minute ear-bones are
found in the Barton Clay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tails of Fishes.</span>&mdash;The tail, as we have previously mentioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575"> 575 </a></span>
is the chief instrument of progressive motion in these
animals; it assumes two principal modifications. In the
greater number of the existing species the vertebral column
terminates in a triangular plate of bone (formed by the
fusion of the last few vertebr&aelig;), to which the caudal fin is
attached symmetrically; and its figure is either rounded, or
divided into two equal lobes or branches; these tails are
termed <i>homocercal</i>, i. e. even-tail. In the second modification
the vertebral column towards its extremity diverges
from a straight line, rises up, and is prolonged into the upper
lobe of the tail; the caudal fin appearing like a rudder, and
its low&#8217;er lobe, being destitute of vertebr&aelig;, is proportionably
very feeble and small, as in the Shark and Dog-fish: this
form of tail is called <i>heterocercal</i>, i. e. unequal-tail (see
<i>Foss. Brit. Mus.</i> p. 421; and <i>Ly.</i> figs. 340, 341). In the
embryonic state the tail in all fishes is heterocercal, and it
becomes homocercal in the progress of development in those
genera which have this type of the caudal appendage. But
few of the existing species have the heterocercal tail, while
it is found in all the fossil fishes that occur in the ancient
secondary strata; namely, the Magnesian limestone, and
antecedent deposits. The rounded and equal-bilobed, or
homocercal, tails, are seen in the fishes from the Chalk,
<i>Wond.</i> pp. 347, &amp;c.; and in the Wealden Lepidotus, <i>Lign.</i>
186; and the unequal or heterocercal tail is shown in the
Amblypterus from the Carboniferous strata, <a href="#lign_187"><i>Lign.</i> 187</a>.</p>

</div>

<p>In the Annals of Nat. Hist, for 1848, p. 304, Prof. M&#8217;Coy
has described and figured an intermediate form of tail, which
he regards as characteristic of the <i>Diplopterus</i> (of the Old
Red Sandstone) and its allies: this the Professor terms the
<i>Diphycercal</i> tail.</p>

<p>From this brief summary of the essential characters of
those durable parts of the organization of fishes, which most
frequently occur in a fossil state, we pass to the investigation
of some illustrative examples of this class of organic remains.
But before describing any entire specimens, it will
be expedient to notice the separate fins, and teeth, which
abound in many deposits; in some instances occurring in
connexion with other parts of the skeleton, but more generally
detached, and constituting the only evidence of the
existence of numerous extinct species and genera. The
greater part belong to the first order&mdash;the Placoidians
(<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. iii.), and to the families of <i>Sharks</i> and
<i>Rays</i>. The osseous dorsal rays of cartilaginous fishes (named
<i>Ichthyodorulites</i> (<i>fossil-fish-weapons</i>) by Dr. Buckland and
Sir H. De la Beche) first demand our notice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ichthyodorulites.</span> <a href="#lign_188"><i>Lign.</i> 188</a>.&mdash;This name is applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577"> 577 </a></span>
to the fossil spines, or rays, of dorsal fins, of which numerous
species occur in the Secondary deposits; they belong, for
the most part, to extinct cartilaginous fishes of the <i>Cestracionid&aelig;</i>
and <i>Hybodontid&aelig;</i> groups. In the osseous tribes the
dorsal spines have at their base two articular processes, by
which they are united to the osselets that support them, as
in the <i>Silurus</i>; but in the cartilaginous, they have no articulations
at the base, and terminate in an obtuse point, which
is implanted in the flesh; the posterior margin is grooved
almost to the upper extremity. They are of a fibrous,
osseous texture. The common Spinax, or Dog-fish (<i>Acanthias
vulgaris</i>), has a spine of this kind in the front of each
dorsal fin. The rays of the Sharks are compressed, and
some have rows of teeth on the posterior margin; in the
genus <i>Cestracion</i> (Port-Jackson Shark), these organs are
strong, triangular, straight, pointed, rounded in front, flat
at the posterior face, and widest at the base; in the Hays
they are flattened or depressed.</p>

<p>These spines are generally capable of being elevated and
depressed, and not only serve the purpose of defence, but, in
many instances, afford support and protection to the soft
rays of the fin; forming, as it were, a moveable mast, by
which the sail can be spread out or lowered at pleasure.</p>

<p>In illustration of this subject, I would first direct attention
to the beautiful fossil, figured <a href="#lign_188"><i>Lign.</i> 188</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1, which
was discovered in the Chalk near Lewes, and is figured, of
the natural size, <i>Foss. South D.</i> tab. xxxix. This ray, or
spine, belongs to one of the Cestraciont fishes (<i>Ptychodus</i>),
whose teeth are so abundant in the Chalk, and will presently
be described. It is composed of fourteen thick, flat, osseous
rods, or strands, intimately united together, with longitudinal
furrows or sutures on the surface. The anterior
margin is embossed, and the projections form on the sides
wide, rounded ribs, and transverse depressions. Towards
the base of the posterior part, there are large osseous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578"> 578 </a></span>
fibres inserted vertically and obliquely, which appear to
have been processes of attachment. The rods, or plates, are
parallel With the posterior margin, and each terminates in a
rounded extremity, or boss, on the front edge of the spine.
This ray is wider at its base than at the superior part the
anterior margin is oblique, and the posterior straight. The
surface, where entire, is covered with a dense osseous substance,
which is finely engrailed.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In 1850 I discovered in the Plastic Clay of Castle Hill
Newhaven, a dorsal fin of Ptychodus, with eight vertebr&aelig;.
A nearly entire fin-ray of this species, three feet in length,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579"> 579 </a></span>
has recently been discovered by Mr. Charles Potter, of
Lewes, in the Chalk near that town. The remains of
another ray, of equal proportions, were found near it; and
these dorsal spines might have belonged to the same individual,
for there are no reasons to forbid the supposition
that the Ptychodus had two dorsal fin-rays. The length of
these spines necessarily indicates a very large fish.</p>

<p>A smaller species of Ichthyodorulite, also found in the
Lewes Chalk, is distinguished from <i>P. spectabilis</i> by its osseous
plates contracting towards their extremities, and terminating
more suddenly on the front margin, producing gibbosities
less acute and more distant than in <i>P. spectabilis</i>; this
species is named <i>P. gibberulus</i>: see <a href="#lign_188"><i>Lign.</i> 188</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_516" id="Footnote_516"></a><a href="#FNanchor_516"><span class="label">[516]</span></a> This fossil is figured of the natural size, Foss. South D. pl. xl.
<i>fig.</i> 3.</p></div>

<p>The bony plates of these fins are occasionally found
lying in irregular groups in the Chalk, as if the fin had
partially decomposed and the plates separated. In one
example, the rays are split asunder by a piece of bone,
apparently a portion of a long pointed tooth, firmly impacted
between them; as if the fish had been seized by
some enemy, and had escaped, with the tooth of its adversary
in its fin. Very fine specimens have been found at
Charing, Kent, by W. Harris, Esq. F.G.S.</p>

<p>In the fragment of an Ichthyodorulite from the Lewes
Chalk, a remarkable structure is displayed; the osseous
plates are united laterally by smooth, longitudinal lines, as
in those above described; but they are also traversed by
numerous oblique, finely-serrated sutures. <a href="#lign_188"><i>Lign.</i> 188</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1<i>a</i>.</p>

<p>The Chalk contains rays of other species of <i>Ptychodus</i>,
as well as of some allied genera. Of these, the most remarkable
are smooth, arched, pointed spines, having a
shallow posterior groove, with an enamelled surface, marked
with fine longitudinal stri&aelig;, and frequent, parallel, oblique
lines. These, according to Sir P. Egerton, belong to a true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580"> 580 </a></span>
<i>Cestracion</i> (see <a href="#Page_584">p. 584</a>): they were first figured and described
by me (<i>Foss. South D.</i> tab. xxxiii. <i>fig.</i> 5) as belonging to the
<i>Acanthias major</i>, and were subsequently assigned to the
genus <i>Spinax</i> by Prof. Agassiz (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> iii. p. 62).</p>

<p>It may be necessary to remark, that the fins first described
have been referred to the fishes which yielded the
large grooved teeth so common in the Chalk (see <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI
fig. 2</i></a>) in consequence of their affinity to existing species,
which have similar fins and teeth; and from the circumstance
that the Sharks of the genus <i>Lamna</i>, whose teeth
also abound in the Chalk, have no dorsal rays of this kind;
still the proof of identity remains to be discovered. In one
specimen only have I observed indications of any other part
of the skeleton; it is a spine of <i>Acanthias major</i>, the
base of which rests on several dorsal vertebr&aelig; (<i>Foss. South D.</i>
tab. xxxiii.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hybodus subcarinatus.</span> <a href="#lign_188"><i>Lign.</i> 188</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3.&mdash;The fishes
of another extinct genus of Sharks, termed <i>Hybodus</i>, from
the gibbous form of the teeth, were also provided with
dorsal spines, which may be readily distinguished from the
preceding. These Ichthyodorulites are generally long,
slightly arched, and terminate in a point at the extremity;
the base, which was implanted in the flesh, is deeply
grooved, and much prolonged, being sometimes equal to
one-third of the entire length. The surface is marked with
strong longitudinal ridges, parallel with the anterior margin
which is rounded and laterally compressed. The posterior
edge, which is more or less flat, has, towards the base two
rows of sharp arched teeth, which gradually approach &#8217;each
other, and blend into one line on the upper part of the ray
There are numerous species of this genus in the Oolite
and Lias. I have found one species in the Chalk and a
few in the Wealden. The small Ray figured <a href="#lign_188"><i>Lign.</i> 188</a>
<i>fig.</i> 3, is from Tilgate Forest, and displays the usual characters
of these fossils. From specimens discovered in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581"> 581 </a></span>
Lias, associated with the teeth, it appears that the <i>Hybodus</i>
had two dorsal fins, each furnished with rays, as in the
recent Dog-fish.</p>

<p>The microscopic structure of these rays is stated by
M. Agassiz to resemble that of the teeth: in some there is
a pulp cavity, which occupies the centre of the spine, and
is surrounded by dentine, in which the calcigerous tubes
radiate direct to the surface; the external enamel is a layer
of dentine, in which the medullary canals are wanting.</p>

<p>In the strata below the Lias there are numerous Ichthyodorulites,
some of a large size, belonging chiefly to the Cestracion
family, and of extinct species, not observed in more
recent deposits. Thus there are several species of dorsal rays
(named <span class="smcap">Onchus</span>, from their hooked form,) that are wide at
the base, and bent backwards, with the posterior margin
destitute of teeth, in the Carboniferous, Devonian, and
Silurian formations; also immense compressed spines, having
small teeth on the posterior margin, and the surface covered
with longitudinal stri&aelig;, and finely toothed, transversely;
hence termed <span class="smcap">Ctenacanthus</span>, or pectinated-spine (<i>Murch.
Sil. Syst.</i> p. 596).</p>

<p>The fossil spine, named <span class="smcap">Orthacanthus</span> (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> vol.
iii. pl. xlv.), and found in the Coal of Manchester, has been
discovered in connexion with the body of the fish to which
it belonged in the Carboniferous deposits of Ruppersdorf in
Bohemia (<i>Geol. Journal</i>, vol. v. part ii. p. 23).</p>

<p>Some Ichthyodorulites have the surface richly ornamented
with stellular tubercles, and are termed <span class="smcap">Asteracanthus</span>,
or starry-spine; there are very large fin-rays of
this kind in the Wealden, Purbeck, Oolites, and Lias.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

Foss.</i> tom. iii. chap. i. About seventy species are enumerated.</p></div>

<p>The Ichthyodorulites of the <i>Rays</i> have no cavity like
those of the <i>Sharks</i>, and are of a depressed form, and more
or less flattened; they are armed with teeth along their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582"> 582 </a></span>
exterior margins, and not on the posterior edge, as in the
latter family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Teeth of Fishes.</span>&mdash;From the durable nature and
striking appearance of many of the fossil teeth of fishes, and
their prodigious numbers in some deposits, they are familiar
objects to the collector. By far the largest proportion of
the detached teeth belongs to various species and genera of
that most numerous, and widely distributed family of voracious
fishes, the <span class="smcap">Sharks</span>. In the Tertiary strata teeth of
this kind occur of a very large size; in the Chalk many
species abound, particularly of the lanceolate and compressed
forms, and of the rugous, mammillated, palatal
teeth, commonly termed <i>palates</i>. As we pass to the more
ancient formations, teeth of different forms prevail; and
those which approach the recent types are either very rare
or altogether absent. We will select some examples of the
different genera in illustration of this subject; the previous
observations on the form and structure of the recent teeth
render but few introductory remarks necessary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Teeth of Sharks.</span>&mdash;The fishes of the Shark and
Ray families belong to the <i>Placoid</i> order; the scales in the
former consist of enamelled plates and tubercles, forming
a <i>shagreen</i> surface; and in the dermal integument of the
latter they appear as spines and bosses, irregularly disposed.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the diversity in appearance of the teeth
of Sharks, they all possess one essential character of structure,
namely, a base, or osseous root of variable form, which
is implanted in the integuments; and a crown, or external
portion, which projects into the mouth, is covered with
enamel or compact dentine, and assumes numerous modifications,
by which the fossil genera are characterized.
These teeth are never imbedded in sockets, nor united to
the dentary margins of the jaws; they only adhere to the
integuments of the mouth, and the covering of the maxill&aelig;;
they possess, in most of the Sharks, great mobility. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583"> 583 </a></span>
are generally disposed in rows; the anterior ones, being
first used, fall out, and are replaced by those on the inner
series. New teeth are also continually formed behind
those in use, and advance successively towards the anterior
rows as the latter are shed, and in their turn occupy the
front rank. (See Cyclop. Anat. <i>Art.</i> <span class="smcap">Teeth.</span>) An examination
of the fossil and recent teeth of Sharks and Rays proves
that the prevailing existing generic types have but few,
if any, representatives in the fossils, except in those which
belong to the Tertiary and Cretaceous formations; while
the genera that appear isolated, as it were, in the present
seas have numerous analogues in the Secondary strata.</p>

<p>The fossil teeth of this family may be divided into two
grand divisions; namely, those which are more or less of a
polygonal, obtusely conical, or depressed form, having a
tesselated arrangement in the mouth; and those of a triangular,
lanceolate shape, with cutting, or serrated edges,
disposed in a series of rows on the jaws. The teeth of the
first group (<i>Cestracionid&aelig;</i>) have most analogy to those of
the living genus <span class="smcap">Cestracion</span> (<i>Port-Jackson Shark</i>); the
second (<i>Sgualid&aelig;</i>) to the <span class="smcap">Sharks</span>, commonly so called.</p>

<p>The Cestracion is the only living representative of a
family of squaloid fishes of a peculiar type, whose remains
occur in almost the earliest fossiliferous deposits; it inhabits
the seas of New Holland and the southern coasts of China.
The jaws of the Cestracion are relatively very large, and are
armed with numerous rows of teeth, essentially of two
kinds; those situated anteriorly, or towards the front of
the mouth, being adapted for seizing and retaining the
food, and the posterior ones for crushing and bruising. The
prehensile teeth are sharp, angular, and pointed: the others
are obtuse, polygonal, enamelled, and disposed in oblique
rows along the margins and inner surface of both jaws;
there are sometimes sixty in each jaw (see <i>Bd.</i> ii. pl. xxvii 11.
<i>fig.</i> <span class="smcap">A</span>). Fossil teeth of this type are exceedingly numerous
in the Chalk, Lias, &amp;c. but are very seldom found in juxtaposition;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584"> 584 </a></span>
the decomposition of the cartilaginous integuments
in which they are imbedded, having, in most examples,
occasioned their displacement and dispersion; specimens,
however, are occasionally discovered, in which numerous
teeth, of various sizes, are disposed in mosaic, in their
natural relative positions.</p>

<p>The extinct forms of this family (<i>Cestracionid&aelig;</i>) are
known almost only by their teeth; and according to the
shape, structure, and sculpture of these organs, M. Agassiz
has arranged them into several genera. They occur in most
of the fossiliferous deposits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cestracion canaliculatus.</span>&mdash;The teeth of a fish belonging
to the existing genus have been discovered in the Chalk of
Kent; they are figured and described by Sir P. Egerton in
the beautiful work by Mr. Dixon.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> This unique specimen
consists of a group of thirteen posterior molar and three or
four detached prehensile anterior teeth, imbedded in a block
of chalk about two inches square. The chief distinction
from the teeth of the recent Cestracion is in the presence of
a large medullary canal which traverses the base of each
tooth: hence the specific name.</p>

a fancied resemblance to a contracted leech. They belong
to an extinct genus of Cestracionts, named <i>Acrodus</i> by
M. Agassiz. The crown of the tooth is enamelled, and covered
with transverse grooves, which diverge from a longitudinal
furrow; the base is in the form of a parallelogram inclined
on its inner side. These teeth were inserted along the

<a href="#lign_191"><i>Lign.</i> 191</a>.&mdash;The palatal teeth, which occur more or less
abundantly in almost every chalk-pit, and are known by the
name of "palates," belong to several species of the genus
Ptychodus. A very common form is figured <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 2</i></a>;
and microscopic views of vertical and transverse sections, as
seen by transmitted light, are shown in figs. 2<sup><i>b</i></sup>, 2<sup><i>c</i></sup>. Groups
of these teeth, somewhat naturally arranged, and varying in
size and form according to the situations they occupied in
the jaws, are occasionally found: one specimen in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586"> 586 </a></span>
British Museum, and formerly in my collection, contains
more than 120 teeth. In general they occur in a very
perfect state, with the osseous base and enamelled crown
entire. The dorsal rays or spines previously described
(<a href="#Page_577">p. 577</a>), are sometimes found with the teeth, and belong to
fishes of the same genus.</p>

<p>These teeth are of an angular form, and more or less
square, the crown is wider than the root, which is obtuse,
truncated, and depressed in the centre; the enamelled part
of the tooth is expanded at the edges, and forms in the
centre a flattened or slightly convex mammillary projection,
which is traversed by large, acute, transverse, parallel
ridges. The borders are granulated, and the sides of the
projection marked with deep vertical plic&aelig; or folds; this
description particularly applies to the species named <i>P.
polygurus</i>, figured in <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Plate VI.</i></a> Dr. Buckland has represented
a fine group of these teeth, <i>Bd.</i> ii. pl. xxvi&#8242;.
Another common species (<i>P. decurrens</i>) is distinguished
from the former by the connexion between the large furrows
on the crown and the granulations on the expanded border,
which diverge from the outer edge of the large folds to the
margin of the enamel.</p>

<p>The microscopic structure of these teeth presents the
same congeries of medullary and calcigerous tubes as those
of the recent Cestracion: see <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Plate VI. figs. 2<sup>b</sup>, 2<sup>c</sup></i></a>.</p>

<p>The teeth of a species of Ptychodus occur in the arenaceous
strata of the Chalk-formation in New Jersey, which
possess the essential characters of the European types, but
differ from them in their configuration; the only specimen
I have seen is figured <a href="#lign_189"><i>Lign.</i> 189</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1; it was presented to
me by Dr. Morton. The enamelled crown forms a conical
projection, traversed by large inosculating ridges, which

<p>There are several kinds of fossil teeth which possess the
same essential structure as those of Psammodus, but differ in
their external characters; these are referred to other genera
by M. Agassiz. Thus <span class="smcap">Orodus</span>, <a href="#lign_189"><i>Lign.</i> 189</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3, comprises
those elongated teeth in which the centre of the
crown forms an obtuse transverse cone, traversed by a ridge
from which oblique furrows diverge transversely towards the
circumference. Similar teeth, but with a smooth, obtusely
conical crown, are referred to the genus <span class="smcap">Helodus</span>. Those
with the crown compressed and elevated, with a sharp edge,
and with the base surrounded by concentric folds, constitute
the type of <span class="smcap">Chomatodes</span>. A similar crown, but subdivided
by deep transverse ridges into dentations, characterises
the genus <span class="smcap">Ctenoptychius</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ceratodus</span> (<i>horn-tooth</i>) <span class="smcap">emarginatus</span>. <a href="#lign_194"><i>Lign.</i> 194</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1.&mdash;Very
curious dental organs, possessing a structure analogous
to that of the teeth of Psammodus, are found in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588"> 588 </a></span>
Bone-bed of the Lias; they consist of consolidated plates
instead of separate teeth; there was probably but one plate
on each side the jaws. The upper margin is generally undulated,
and more or less worn by use. These dental plates
are composed of two distinct layers; the lowermost portion,
or root, is an osseous, reticulated tissue, as in cartilaginous
fishes in general; and the upper consists of dentine, with
minute parallel vertical tubes, as in Psammodus; these
tubes are a continuation of the medullary tissue of the
osseous root.</p>

<p>One species occurs in the Great Oolite at Stonesfield, and
very many forms abound in the Bone-bed at Aust Cliff, near
Westbury on Avon: and in the Trias (bone-bed) of Germany
the teeth of several species of Ceratodus are very abundant.</p>

<p>The fishes to which these fossil teeth, referred to <i>Ceratodus</i>,
belonged were most probably Cestracionts; the ray-spine
known as <i>Nemacanthus</i> is provisionally assigned to
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Edaphodon.</span> <a href="#lign_190"><i>Lign.</i> 190</a> and <a href="#lign_191"><i>Lign.</i> 191</a>, <i>Ly.</i> p. 276, <i>fig.</i> 309.&mdash;The
Chim&aelig;roid fishes, though formerly placed with the
Plagiostomes (Sharks and Bays), constitute a distinct group,
of which there are but two recent genera, though several
occur in a fossil state. Their dental organs are very peculiar.
Their mandibles are furnished with two or more
pairs of oblong teeth, composed of long hollow cylindrical
columns, placed nearly at right angles to the grinding surface,
which is pitted with minute depressions. These teeth are
never shed, but are persistent, and grow on through life, as
in the Rodentia, exhibiting in this respect a striking contrast
with those of the Sharks, which are feeble and numerous,
and constantly replaced by rows of successional teeth.</p>

<p>Fossil teeth of several species, some much larger than the
recent, have been found in the Tertiary, Cretaceous, and
Oolitic deposits. The first British specimen was discovered
in the Chalk-marl at Hamsey, in 1820, by myself; but its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589"> 589 </a></span>
nature was not suspected until more perfect examples were
obtained from the Kimmeridge Clay at Shotover by Sir P.
Egerton, and were submitted to Dr. Buckland, who subsequently
ascertained their characters and relations by an
examination of the dental organs of a recent <i>Chim&aelig;ra</i> in
the Museum at Leyden in 1835.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>Many specimens, both of the upper and lower mandibles,
have since been discovered in the Eocene beds, Chalk, Upper
Greensand, Galt, Kimmeridge Clay, and Stonesfield Slate.
The subject has been carefully investigated by Sir P. Egerton;
and this eminent Ichthyologist has tabulated the principal
forms, and arranged them under five genera.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>In some species the external vertical wall of the plate is
formed of hard dentine, resembling enamel; in others the
dentine is disposed in isolated ramifications, producing a
dendritical appearance; the modifications of this structure
occasion the differences observable in the dental plates of
the various species. In some, compact dentine with parallel
canals constitutes the mass of the tooth; in others, the
squamous dentine with ramifying tubes prevails.</p>

<p>I have figured the right upper and lower mandibles of the
type named <span class="smcap">Edaphodon</span> (<i>pavement-tooth</i>), in which there are
<i>three</i> teeth or dental tubercles on each ramus of both jaws,
<a href="#lign_191"><i>Lign.</i> 191</a>: the lower mandible is produced anteriorly into

(2 <i>s</i>) is broad at the base, and contracts gradually
forward until the margins meet at the apex. In <i>Ischyodus</i> the
lower jaw is deeper, less produced in front, and the margins
of the symphysis are parallel until abruptly truncated at the
extremities: the upper jaw has <i>four</i> tubercles on each side.</p>

for this genus of Chim&aelig;roids.</p></div>

<p>The upper jaw in <span class="smcap">Elasmodus</span> has but three tubercles, as
in Edaphodon, but the dentine of which they are composed
is confluent, being rolled round like a scroll in the substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591"> 591 </a></span>
of the bone, one edge forming the margin of the tooth, and
the other being buried deep in its centre.</p>

<p>The dorsal fin-ray or spine of the Edaphodon is laterally
compressed, with the posterior margin grooved, and the
edges armed with fine teeth: I have a specimen of the
spine, with a pair of inferior mandibles of the same individual,
imbedded in a block of chalk from Kent; by favour
of Mrs. Smith, of Tunbridge Wells.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hybodus.</span> <a href="#lign_192"><i>Lign.</i> 192</a>, figs. 1, 2. (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxvii<sup><i>d</i></sup>.)&mdash;Intermediate
between the obtuse crushing teeth of the Sharks
previously described, and those sharp, angular, pointed,
dental organs of the Squaloids, are those of the fishes
which M. Agassiz has arranged in a sub-family or group
termed <i>Hybodonts</i>; the teeth of which are characterised
by their transversely elongated form, and the series of subacute,
compressed, conical cusps or points, which compose
the crown. The median cone is the principal, the lateral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592"> 592 </a></span>
points being shorter and smaller, as in <a href="#lign_192"><i>Lign.</i> 192</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2;
in some species the difference between the median and
lateral cones is greater, in others less, as in <i>fig.</i> 1. These
cusps have a coating of dense enamel, which is plicated longitudinally
on both faces. The base, which almost equals the
crown in size, is composed of a coarse osseous substance.
The internal structure of the crown differs from that of the
Cestracionts, in having no principal pulp-cavity, and in
being chiefly composed of dendritical dentine, with reticulated
medullary canals. The form and organization of these
teeth show them to have been instruments for cutting and
tearing food. The Hybodonts, as we have already stated
(<a href="#Page_581">p. 581</a>), possessed two spinous dorsal fins; in their habits
and economy they probably did not differ from the ordinary
Sharks. Teeth and spines of this genus are common in the
Trias, Lias, Oolite, and Walden, and occur in the Green Sand
and Chalk. There are several species of teeth and fins in
the strata of Tilgate Forest (<i>Foss. Til. For.</i> pl. x.). In
general the teeth are found detached, but occasionally they
occur in their natural position, adhering to the mineralized
cartilaginous jaws (<i>Petrif.</i> <i>Lign.</i> 97); as in the beautiful
fossil figured <i>Bd.</i> pl. xxvii.<sup><i>d</i></sup>; and in the fine specimen of
<i>H. basanus</i>, from the Isle of Wight, figured in the <i>Geol.
Soc. Journ.</i> vol. pl. iv. There are several related genera,
founded on the situation, form, and division of the principal
cusps of the teeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sharks with Cutting Teeth.</span>&mdash;The jaws of the common
squaloid fishes, as the <span class="smcap">Lamna</span> (<i>Porbeagle</i>) and <span class="smcap">Carcharias</span>
(<i>Great White Shark</i>), are so common in collections of natural
history, as to render a description unnecessary. The numerous
vertical rows of angular, laterally compressed, pointed
teeth, with sharp or serrated edges&mdash;in some species consisting
of a simple trenchant cusp, in others with small lateral
teeth, or denticles, at the base, are characters with which
all are familiar. Fossil teeth of this form are extremely

abundant in the Tertiary and Cretaceous deposits; and are
commonly in a beautiful state of preservation. The genera
of these fossil teeth are founded on the solidity or hollow
structure of the cusps, their possessing cutting or serrated
edges, and the presence or absence of lateral denticles. But
the last character cannot in every instance be relied upon,
for some recent Sharks have rows of teeth both with and
without denticles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carcharodon productus.</span> <a href="#lign_192"><i>Lign.</i> 192</a>, fig 3.&mdash;The genus
Carcharias comprises the large Sharks with cutting triangular
teeth, crenated (<i>notched</i>) on their margins, and having
a broad base. In <i>Carcharodon</i>, the teeth differ from those
of Carcharias in being solid in the centre, while in the
latter they are hollow; but in both genera the teeth
exhibit the same reticulated structure of medullary and calcigerous
tubes. The <i>White Shark</i> and other large species
belong to these genera; some of which are upwards of forty
feet in length. But even these colossal fishes must have
been far surpassed in magnitude by the extinct species of
the Tertiary deposits, if the teeth afford a scale of proportions;
for some of the fossil teeth from Malta and the
United States are six inches long, and five wide at the
base;<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> being twice the size of the teeth in the largest living

<p><span class="smcap">Lamna elegans.</span> <a href="#lign_193"><i>Lign.</i> 193</a>, <i>fig.</i> 6.&mdash;The fishes of the
genus <i>Lamna</i> (to which the recent shark called the <i>Porbeagle</i>
belongs) have teeth with smooth trenchant edges, and a
small sharp denticle (<i>little tooth</i>) on each side the base, as in
the fossil, <a href="#lign_193"><i>Lign.</i> 193</a>, <i>fig.</i> 6. The specimen, <i>fig.</i> 2, although
devoid of denticles, probably belongs to the same genus, for
reasons already explained. Several species abound in the
Chalk; and they are associated with teeth, which are relatively
wider and shorter, and have large compressed denticles;
the latter are arranged in a separate genus, named
<span class="smcap">Otodus</span> (<i>eared-tooth</i>), by M. Agassiz. The specimen figured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595"> 595 </a></span>
<a href="#lign_192"><i>Lign.</i> 192</a>, <i>fig.</i> 5, represents <i>O. obliquus</i>; another species,
<i>Otodus appendiculatus</i>, is abundant in the Sussex Chalk.
The large, wide, triangular, smooth teeth, with trenchant
edges, and destitute of lateral denticles, so common in the
Chalk, are related to Lamna, and are comprised in the
genus <i>Oxyrhina</i> (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. v. tab. xxxiii.).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notidanus microdon.</span> <a href="#lign_193"><i>Lign.</i> 193</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3.&mdash;These teeth
differ remarkably from those of the other genera of
Sharks. The crown of each tooth is composed of a series
of sharp angular enamelled points, the first of which is the
largest, and is notched on its anterior edge; the base or
root is osseous, flat, with a slight longitudinal depression
below the border of enamel. These teeth are comparatively
rare in the Chalk. One species has been found in the
Oxford Clay; and several in the Tertiary strata. Specimens
occur in Hordwell Cliff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corax pristodontus.</span> <a href="#lign_193"><i>Lign.</i> 193</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1.&mdash;The teeth of
the fossil <i>Corax</i> chiefly differ from those of the recent genus
<i>Galeus</i>, to which the <i>Tope</i>, or Grey Shark, belongs, in being
solid; they are of a triangular form, with a deep concavity
or notch on the posterior margin, the base of which is prolonged
and forms three or four angular points: the anterior
edge of the tooth is finely serrated. The root of the tooth,
as in <i>Notidanus</i>, is a broad osseous plate. There is much
diversity of form in the Chalk specimens, which are all of a
small size, as in <a href="#lign_193"><i>Lign.</i> 193</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1. In Sussex they are more
common in the Chalk-marl than in the Chalk.</p>

<p>The only fossil teeth of the Shark family resembling those
of the tertiary Carchariodonts, that have been discovered in
the strata below the Chalk, are from the carboniferous deposits
of Yorkshire and Armagh. These teeth are compressed,
triangular, crenated on the edges, with large plaits
or folds on the enamelled surface, towards the base of the
crown. M. Agassiz refers them to a new genus, viz. <span class="smcap">Carcharopsis</span>,
with the specific name of <i>Prototypus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596"> 596 </a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Vertebr&aelig; of Sharks.</span>&mdash;As the cartilaginous nature
of the skeleton in this family renders it unfavourable
to preservation in the mineral kingdom, the durable parts
already described, and those which are ossified, are almost
the only relics found in a fossil state. The dermal integument
is, however, sometimes preserved; and I had a beautiful
example of shagreen, composed of irregular minute
hexagonal scales, one of which is represented highly magnified,
<a href="#lign_185"><i>Lign.</i> 185</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1.</p>

<p>In the <i>Galeus</i> and <i>Carcharias</i> the vertebr&aelig; are more
ossified than in many other genera of cartilaginous fishes,
and fossil vertebr&aelig; of these sharks often occur in the cretaceous
and other strata. Groups of vertebr&aelig; of a large size
occasionally occur in the Sussex Chalk; they are circular,
biconcave, and very short; one specimen is four inches in
diameter, and one inch long; their concavities are consequently
shallow. These vertebra: are composed of two shallow
conical disks, which are united by their summits, at the
axis, and are connected and supported by numerous wedge-shaped
plates, that radiate from the centre to the periphery
(see <i>Foss. South D.</i> pl. xxxiii. <i>fig.</i> 10). My collection contained
a connected series of forty small vertebr&aelig; from the
Chalk near Lewes, which probably belonged to the same
species of Shark as the dorsal spine named <i>Spinax major</i>
(<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. iii. pl. xl<sup><i>a</i></sup> <i>fig.</i> 6).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Squaloraia.</span> In the Lias of Lyme Regis, that inexhaustible
storehouse of fossil treasures, a considerable portion of
the skeleton of a very remarkable fish, partaking of the
characters of the Sharks and Rays, was discovered by Miss
Mary Aiming, and is now in the Museum of the Bristol
Institution.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> In this fish the jaws are prolonged into a
beak, like the Pristis (<i>Saw-fish</i>). It has the head of a Shark,
with a long beak; vertebr&aelig; of the Rays; with pectoral and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597"> 597 </a></span>
ventral fins, almost equally developed; a tail armed with, a

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Pristis, or Saw-fish.</span>&mdash;This well-known predatory
fish, which is allied to the Rays and Sharks, and referred by
M. Agassiz to the family of <i>Raiid&aelig;</i>, has projecting from its
snout an osseous, flat, horizontal plate, or beak, equal in
length to one-third of the fish, and armed on each side by
a row of elongated, compressed, pointed teeth, implanted in
sockets; the front margin of these teeth is convex, the
posterior concave; this defence is termed the saw, and constitutes
a most powerful weapon. The <i>Pristis</i> has also
numerous small obtuse teeth on the jaws. The remains of
the beak, or saw, of an extinct species of Pristis have been
discovered in the Bagshot Sand at Goldsworth Hill, Surrey,<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a>
and three other species have been found in the London

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Rays.</span>&mdash;The teeth of these fishes are characterised
by the extraordinary transversal development of the median
teeth in both jaws. Instead of pointed teeth, they have
wide, flat, tesselated dentary plates in each jaw, composed of
distinct pieces, juxtaposed and connected by their margins,
and united by fine sutures. In some species the teeth are
equal, in others of various sizes; they present numerous
modifications of arrangement, and are always disposed in
symmetrical rows. In the genus <span class="smcap">Myliobatis</span> (<i>Eagle-ray</i>)
the teeth of the median row are of an extraordinary width,
while their length does not exceed that of the lateral plates,
or chevrons, which are of an irregular hexagonal form, and
disposed in two or three rows on each side. There are five
living species of <i>Myliobatis</i>, and eighteen fossil species have
been found in the Tertiary strata at the Isle of Sheppey,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598"> 598 </a></span>
Hordwell Cliff, and Bracklesham Bay. I have figured a
specimen of part of the upper jaw of a species (<i>M. micropleurus</i>,
<a href="#lign_194"><i>Lign.</i> 194</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2), in which the median teeth
are very wide, and have two lateral rows of small, irregularly
hexagonal, plates. The surface of the teeth in
this species is smooth; but in others it is striated longitudinally
(<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxvi<sup><i>d</i></sup>. <i>fig.</i> 14). In an allied genus, <span class="smcap">&AElig;tobatis</span>,
from the Tertiary beds at Bracklesham, the lower
jaw projects beyond the upper, and in each there is a row
of flat, transverse teeth, <i>without</i> lateral plates.</p>

<p>To this notice of the fossil Rays, we may add, that a
gigantic <span class="smcap">Torpedo</span> has been discovered in that celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599"> 599 </a></span>
locality of Ichthyolites, Monte Bolca: and that Sir Philip
Egerton has recently enriched his matchless collection of
fossil fishes, by a perfect Ray, from Mount Lebanon. It is
figured and described in the <i>Quarterly Geol. Journ.</i> vol. i.
pl. v. p. 225, under the name of <span class="smcap">Cyclobatis oligodactylus</span>.
It is a small species, resembling the common Rays in its
general appearance, but is surrounded by a broad, flexible,
cartilagino-membranous fin; the skin is smooth, the teeth
and eyes are small, the tail is slender; there are no traces
of dermal spines, tubercles, or defensive weapons. In many
points of structure it resembles the Torpedo; and may
possibly, like that fish, have possessed an electric organ. It
is 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches long, and 3 inches wide across the expanded
fins.</p>

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL ICHTHYOLOGY; COMPRISING THE GANOID, CTENOID,

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fishes we have hitherto examined belong to the first
order, the <i>Placoidians</i>; we now pass to the fossil remains of
the second order, the <i>Ganoidians</i>, which are distinguished
by their brilliant angular scales, formed of osseous or horny
plates, densely covered with enamel. This order contains
six or more families, comprising many genera and numerous
species; our investigation must be restricted to a selection
from the principal genera of the <i>Ganoids</i>, properly so called,
and of the <i>Sauroids</i>, or lizard-like fishes.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_530" id="Footnote_530"></a><a href="#FNanchor_530"><span class="label">[530]</span></a> The fishes of these orders are described in <i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. ii.</p></div>

<p>The first family, termed <span class="smcap">Lepidoides</span>, contains several
genera, which are defined as possessing either numerous
rows of brush-teeth, or of obtuse conical teeth; flat, rhomboidal
scales, arranged parallel with the body; and an
osseous, or partially osseous, skeleton. In one division of
this family, the body is either elongated or fusiform, the
mouth furnished with brash-teeth only, and the tail heterocercal,
or unequally bilobed (see <a href="#Page_576">p. 576</a>). To this group
belong several genera, which are restricted to the Secondary
formations more ancient than the Oolite; while the other
group, with homocercal tails, lived in the Oolitic and Cretaceous
seas. Two genera, in particular, abound in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601"> 601 </a></span>
Permian and Carboniferous strata; namely, <i>Amblypterus</i>
and <i>Pal&aelig;oniscus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_531" id="Footnote_531"></a><a href="#FNanchor_531"><span class="label">[531]</span></a> For the characters, affinities, and distribution of these and the
allied genera of the Heterocerque Ganoid fishes, see Sir P. Egerton&#8217;s
Memoir in the sixth volume of the Quarterly Geological Journal.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Amblypterus.</span> <a href="#lign_187"><i>Lign.</i> 187</a>. <i>Wond.</i> p. 740. <i>Bd.</i> pl. xxvii.<sup><i>b</i></sup>.&mdash;The
fishes of this genus, as the name indicates, have very
large and wide fins, composed of numerous rays. The
scales are rhomboidal and finely enamelled; the tail is
heterocercal. The figures referred to convey a correct idea
of the form and external characters. Beautiful pyritous
imprints of Amblypteri occur in the Carboniferous slate of
Saarbr&uuml;ck, in Lorraine; and fine specimens in the ironstone
nodules of the same locality. On the shore at Newhaven,
near Leith, similar fossils occur in nodules washed
out of the cliffs of coal-shale (<i>Bd.</i> p. 278).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;oniscus.</span> <i>Ly.</i> p. 304.&mdash;The fishes of this genus
differ from those of Amblypterus in the relatively moderate
size of the scales, and the numerous little rays on their
margins. They have rhomboidal scales, which in some
species are very small, and in others large. They have
numerous brush-teeth. Several peculiar species, found in
the marl-slates and magnesian limestones of the Permian
system, are very widely distributed, occurring in the British
Isles, Germany, and the United States.</p>

<p>In some localities the small species occur in groups; on
a slab of red sandstone, in the Museum of the Geological
Society, from Tyrone, between two and three hundred perfect
fishes (<i>P. catopterus</i>) are imbedded on a space not exceeding
two feet square.</p>

<p>A remarkable circumstance relating to the fishes of this
genus is the almost constant absence of the bodies of the
vertebr&aelig; in otherwise well-preserved specimens, and in
which the spinal processes and the ribs are entire: occasionally,
however, examples occur with some of the vertebr&aelig;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602"> 602 </a></span>
perfect. An explanation of the above phenomenon may
perhaps be found in the probable originally cartilaginous
nature of the bodies of the vertebr&aelig;, and the osseous structure
of the enduring apophyses and ribs;<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> while those rare
specimens which possess a few bony vertebr&aelig; may be
regarded as exceptions, in which ossification took place in a
structure essentially cartilaginous.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_532" id="Footnote_532"></a><a href="#FNanchor_532"><span class="label">[532]</span></a> Professor Owen states that a similar condition of the spinal
column obtains in the fossil Microdonts.&mdash;<i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> 1846.</p></div>

<p>The fishes found in the copper-schists of the Zechstein,
at Mansfeld in Saxony, are generally impregnated with
copper pyrites, and their scales are as brilliant as burnished
gold. These ichthyolites are almost always in contorted
and twisted positions; which appearance M. Agassiz attributes
to contraction of the muscular tissues after death,
during the progress of decomposition, and before the fishes
sank down and became imbedded in the mud. (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i>
tom. ii. p. 70.)</p>

<p>The fishes of the genus Pal&aelig;oniscus are often found in
the shales and marls of the Permian and Carboniferous
systems of England and Scotland. At East Thickley, in
the county of Durham, numerous specimens have been
found.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> The lower Carboniferous strata at Burdie-house,
a locality we have before mentioned, have yielded several
species of Pal&aelig;oniscus, associated with teeth and other
remains of large sauroid fishes.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> On the continent also they
prevail in deposits of the same epoch; Eisleben and Mansfeld,
iii Saxony, are well-known localities. In North
America they have been discovered in strata of probably
the same age.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> In fine, the genera Amblypterus and
Pal&aelig;oniscus may be regarded as characteristic "medals" of
the geological epoch which intervened between the Devonian
and Triassic formations.</p>

<p>We will next examine a few genera of the homocercal

<p><span class="smcap">Dapedius.</span> <a href="#lign_195"><i>Lign.</i> 195</a>.&mdash;At Lyme Regis, and other productive
localities of the fossils of the Lias, large masses of
angular enamelled scales, and occasionally entire specimens
of the fishes to which they belonged, have for many years
been collected. Sir H. De la Beche first scientifically investigated
the structure of these Ichthyolites, and pointed
out their characters and relations. The Dapedius (of which
a restored figure is given in <a href="#lign_195"><i>Lign.</i> 195</a>) is a flat, laterally
compressed fish, with a rounded head, and fins of moderate
size. The body rapidly contracts towards the root of the
tail, the fin of which is large and symmetrically lobed.
The mouth is furnished with several rows of small conical
teeth, which are crenated at their summits, and has brush-teeth
on the palatine bones; the jaws are short. The
scales are rhomboidal, highly polished, and united laterally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604"> 604 </a></span>
by short processes; as in many other ganoid fishes. It
belongs to the Lepidoids.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Tetragonolepis</span> is a Liassic fish, very similar in
shape to the Dapedius. It was formerly grouped with the
<i>Lepidoidei</i>, but Sir P. Egerton has lately discovered that it

scales and teeth, and that it belongs to the Pycnodonts.</p>

and of a rhomboidal or lozenge form, and teeth equally
dark and glossy, of an obtuse hemispherical figure, are very
common in the Wealden strata of the south-east of England
and in the Isle of Purbeck. They are called by the quarry-men
<i>fishes' scales</i> and <i>eyes</i>. The collectors of the last century
used to term the obtuse circular teeth of this and the
related genera <i>Bufonites</i>, from a supposition that they were
formed in the heads of toads. These relics belong to an
extinct genus named <i>Lepidotus</i>, which contains numerous
species, that are distributed in the Oolite, Purbeck, and
Wealden formations. These fishes resembled the Carps in
their general form, but they have no anatomical relations to
that family. The body is covered with large rhomboidal
scales, which are protected on the external surface by a
thick plate of enamel (Lign 196, <i>fig.</i> 3). The lateral line,
which is slightly arched, passes direct from the operculum
to the middle of the insertion of the caudal fin. The head,
and even the face, are cased with osseous and enamelled
plates. The bones of the surface of the skull are very large,
and are connected by sinuous sutures. The jaws are short
and rounded, and furnished with a row of obtuse, conical,
circular teeth (see <a href="#lign_197"><i>Lign.</i> 197</a>), and several rows of sessile
teeth, more or less contracted at the base, which forms a
very short pedicle that is anchylosed to the bone. The
fossil Lepidoti are found, for the most part, in fluviatile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605"> 605 </a></span>
deposits, as in the Purbeck and Wealden strata; and it is
probable they inhabited the rivers or sea-coasts, and not
deep waters.</p>

<p>The scales and teeth figured <a href="#lign_196"><i>Lign.</i> 196</a>, 197, belong to
the larger species of the Wealden. The remains of this fish
were first collected in Tilgate Forest, and several teeth and:
scales are figured <i>Foss. Til. For.</i> pl. v. and x.; considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606"> 606 </a></span>
portions of connected scales have since been found; also the
head entire, and the fins more or less perfect. A specimen
in my collection retained a mass of the scales near the insertion
of the tail, a foot wide; indicating the original to
have been twelve feet long, and its body three feet broad.
The scales are distinguished from other species by the folds
or grooves on their enamelled surface; and the teeth by
the contracted base, or pedicle, which is a little narrower
than the crown (<a href="#lign_197"><i>Lign.</i> 197</a>, and <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 10</i></a>). A species
(<i>L. Fittoni</i>) closely related to the above is equally abundant
in the Weald of Sussex; the scales are not striated, and the
teeth have no pedicle.</p>

<p>The intimate structure of the teeth of the Lepidotus is
beautifully preserved, and may be easily examined in thin
transverse and vertical sections, viewed by transmitted light:
see <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 10</i></a>. The dentine is composed of bundles of
tubes, continued from the cells of the osseous base, radiating
in a vertical direction to the surface of the tooth, as seen in
<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 10</i></a>, and giving off branches at an acute angle;
but when more highly magnified, the finer branches are
seen to be spread out and arched at their extremities, "presenting
the appearance of the stems of corn, beaten down
by heavy rain."<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607"> 607 </a></span></p></div>

<p>The dorsal and pectoral fins of these fishes are very strong,
and consist of several bony rays. There is a double row of
acuminated enamelled scales, arranged more or less obliquely,
on the anterior margin of the dorsal and anal fins,
and on both margins of the caudal: part of the first ray of
a dorsal fin, with scales, is represented <a href="#lign_196"><i>Lign.</i> 196</a>, <i>fig.</i> 5.</p>

<p>A small species of Lepidotus (<i>A. minor</i>) is common in
the Purbeck limestone, and specimens may often be procured
from the quarries near Swanage;<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> it has also been
found at Hildesheim, in Saxony, by M. Roemer. The
detached scales abound in the limestones; and the splendid
fossil reptile from Swanage, figured <i>Petrif.</i> <i>Lign.</i> 38, is
sprinkled with the scales and minute teeth of this fish.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_538" id="Footnote_538"></a><a href="#FNanchor_538"><span class="label">[538]</span></a> Fine specimens of this fish are in the British Museum (<i>Petrifactions</i>,
p. 429), and in the Museum at Dorchester.</p></div>

<p>The majority of the species of Lepidotus belong to the
Lower Oolites and the Lias. The habits of the Lepidoti,
as indicated by the form and structure of the teeth, were
those of fishes whose food consisted of crustaceans, shelly
mollusca, &amp;c.; for the dental organs are peculiarly adapted
for the crushing and grinding of such substances; and the
teeth of the adult fishes are generally worn down by use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pycnodus.</span> <a href="#Plate_I"><i>Pl. I. fig. 3</i></a>; <a href="#lign_194"><i>Lign.</i> 194</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3.&mdash;The fishes of
the family of Pycnodonts, so named from the thickness of
their teeth, have an osseous skeleton, a flat body covered
with rhomboidal scales, and flat or rounded teeth disposed
in several rows on the palatine, vomerine, intermaxillary,
and premandibular bones.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> As in the Lepidotus, these
teeth are constructed for crushing, and have generally a
smooth, dense, convex or flattened crown, with a highly
polished surface. This genus belongs chiefly to the Oolite;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608"> 608 </a></span>
it is found also in the Lias, Chalk, and Wealden. A perfect
fish of the genus <span class="smcap">Pycnodus</span> (<i>P. rhombus</i>), from the Jura
limestone, at Torre d&#8217;Orlando, near Castellamare, is figured
in the <a href="#Plate_I">frontispiece</a> of the first volume of this work; and a
vomerine bone, with teeth, from Tilgate Forest, in <a href="#lign_194"><i>Lign.</i> 194</a>,
 <i>fig.</i> 3. In the last fossil there is a median row of flat,,
elongated, transversely arched, smooth, glossy teeth, with a
double alternate row of small sub-circular teeth on each
side, attached to the bone, which is imbedded in Tilgate
grit. Specimens of this kind, belonging to one or more
species of Pycnodus, occur in the Wealden of Sussex;
they were among my earliest discoveries in Tilgate Forest
(<i>Foss. Til. For.</i> pl. xvii. figs. 26, 27). Examples are met;
with in which all the teeth are shed, and the bony plate of
the vomer alone remains.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_539" id="Footnote_539"></a><a href="#FNanchor_539"><span class="label">[539]</span></a> The intermaxillary, palatine, and vomerine bones compose the
vault or roof of the mouth; the vomer occupying the middle; the
intermaxillary the front; and the palatine bones the sides; the premandibular
bones belong to the lower border of the mouth.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gyrodus.</span> <a href="#lign_198"><i>Lign.</i> 198</a>.&mdash;In another genus of the Pycnodonts,
termed Gyrodus, the crowns of the teeth are deeply
furrowed, the structure of the dentine is very dense, and the
pulp-cavity large and simple. One species occurs in the
Speeton clay of Yorkshire, and another in the Sussex weald;
but the teeth are chiefly found in the Oolite and Chalk.
As in Pycnodus, the teeth are distributed in rows on the
bones composing the roof, floor, and sides of the mouth.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

in the British Museum (<i>Foss. Brit. Mus.</i> p. 439).</p></div>

<p>These characters are beautifully displayed in the Russian
specimen, <a href="#lign_198"><i>Lign.</i> 198</a>. This interesting fossil was presented
to me by the late Stephen Cattley, jun. Esq., who collected it
in 1839, in a valley near <span class="smcap">Rjeff</span>, a village on the banks of
the Volga. Mr. Cattley informed me "that many fossils
are found in that and the neighbouring valleys; and the
locality is frequented by Russian geologists when the season
permits, which is but seldom, owing to the long duration of
the snow, and the heavy rains which accompany the thaw."
This specimen consists of the vomerine bone, which is of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609"> 609 </a></span>
coarse texture, and five rows of teeth; the median row
consists of very large elliptical teeth; those of the lateral
rows are much smaller and arranged alternately. The peculiar
structure of the teeth of this genus<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> is finely displayed
in this fossil. The ample, deep, and simple pulp-cavity is
seen in several teeth, where the crown of dentine has been
worn off, filled with a pure white calcareous spar; one of
these cavities is marked a. The dentine is extremely dense,
consisting of very minute calcigerous tubes, and passes into
an external layer of enamel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610"> 610 </a></span></p>

<p>The fishes of the genus <i>Gyrodus</i> have the body large, flat,

the tail is forked, with equal elongated lobes. The scales
are laterally connected by strong processes, as in Lepidotus.</p>

<p>Other genera related to the foregoing occur in the Oolite;
as for example, Microdon, thus named from the smallness of

<span class="smcap">Placodus</span>, in which the teeth are few, flat, and of great size;<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>

<p><span class="smcap">Cephalaspides of the Devonian System.</span>&mdash;The remains
of the three genera of Ganoid fishes that we have now to
notice are of a very remarkable character, and are found
exclusively in the Devonian or Old Red system; most frequently
in Scotland, but also in other parts of the British
Isles, and in Europe and America. These fishes agree in
one general character, that of having extensive osseous
plates, or scutcheons; their general aspect will be understood
by reference to <a href="#lign_199"><i>Lign.</i> 199</a>, 200, 201. There are no
vestiges of the bodies of the vertebr&aelig;, which, therefore,
were probably cartilaginous. These fishes constitute a
distinct family with the name <i>Cephalaspides</i>, from the character
of the first genus we propose to describe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cephalaspis Lyellii.</span> <a href="#lign_199"><i>Lign.</i> 199</a>, 200.&mdash;The most
striking feature in the Ichthyolites of this genus is the
enormous scutcheon, or buckler, which forms the head,
and is prolonged posteriorly into two lateral horns or points;
this part so closely resembles the cephalic shield of certain
trilobites (see <a href="#lign_175"><i>Lign.</i> 175</a>), that the first found specimens
were supposed to be the remains of unknown crustaceans.
The name <i>Cephalaspis</i> (<i>buckler-head</i>) is derived from this
character. This remarkable appearance is occasioned by
the intimate anchylosis of all the bones of the cranium.
The body of these fishes is relatively smaller than the head;
it has one dorsal fin, and terminates in a tapering tail, supporting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612"> 612 </a></span>
a fin. There are two small eyes, placed towards
the middle of the head. The body is covered with rhomboidal
scales; and the head with discoidal scales, which are
highly ornamented with radiated markings<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> (<i>Ly.</i> p. 344,
<i>fig.</i> 396). There are four species of Cephalaspis at present
known.</p>

<p>The other genera are equally unlike any recent types of
the class of fishes. No perfect examples have been found,
and some parts of their structure are still unknown; the
annexed figures, <a href="#lign_201"><i>Lign.</i> 201</a>, have been drawn by Mr.
Dinkel (the eminent artist employed by M. Agassiz), with
scrupulous accuracy, no part being introduced which is
not clearly demonstrated in some one specimen; and the
form of the scutcheons is made out very distinctly, to aid
the collector in discriminating the detached plates, which
are the most common relics of these singular beings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pterichthys cornutus.</span><a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> <a href="#lign_201"><i>Lign.</i> 201</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1.&mdash;This fish
is distinguished by its two wing-like lateral appendages;
whence the name of the genus (<i>winged-fish</i>). These processes,
like the spines on the gill-covers of the common Bullhead
(<i>Cottus gobio</i>), are weapons of defence. In some
specimens they are extended at right angles to the body
(<i>Ly.</i> p. 345, <i>fig.</i> 400).</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_545" id="Footnote_545"></a><a href="#FNanchor_545"><span class="label">[545]</span></a> The first fish of this genus was discovered by Mr. Hugh Miller,
in whose charming little work, "The Old Red Sandstone; or, New
Walks in an Old Field," will be found a very graphic description of
the Old Red fishes; I know not a more fascinating volume on any
branch of British geology. Consult also Sir P. Egerton&#8217;s elaborate
paper on the <i>Pterichthys</i> in the Geol. Journal, vol. iv. p. 302.</p></div>

<p>The head and anterior part of the body are covered with
large angular tuberculated scutcheons. The under surface
of the body is flat and protected by five plates, a quadrangular
plate occupying the centre. The upper part of the
body is convex; the form and disposition of the dorsal
scutcheons are shown in <a href="#lign_201"><i>Lign.</i> 201</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1. There are two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613"> 613 </a></span>
eyes, which are placed in front of the lateral spines: see
<i>fig.</i> 1. The tail is of an angular form, and as long as
the body; it is covered with scales, and considered by
M. Agassiz to have been the only instrument of locomotion.
The British species of this genus, of which ten are known,
are all very small, varying in length from one to ten inches.</p>

notches on the edge of the buckler indicate the place of the
eyes on the sides of the head. There is no indication of
lateral spines. The tail is very long, covered with scales,
and supports a fin. The plates of the body are tuberculated,
as in Pterichthys. There are six or eight teeth on each half
of the lower jaw (and probably as many on the upper), with a
curious group of teeth situated on its symphisis. The teeth are
chiefly composed of bone, passing into dentine at their surface.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>These fishes are from a few inches to two feet in length;
six species have been discovered; and their remains are the
most abundant of the Ichthyolites of the Old Red. Patches
of detached scales, and isolated osseous plates, are very
frequent in the sandy cornstones, and the subcrystalline
masses of limestone. These fragments are usually of a
brilliant blue or purple colour; and, strongly contrasting
with the dull red tint of the surrounding rock, are easily
recognised. The colour is supposed to be due to the
presence of phosphate of iron, which has communicated a
similar tint to the Ichthyolites of the Caithness Schist.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Sauroid Fishes.</span> (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. ii.)&mdash;The
family of Ganoid, fishes termed <i>Sauroid</i>, or lizard-like, by
M. Agassiz, are so named in consequence of certain peculiarities
in their organization which are found in no other
animals of this class, but exist in reptiles. There are but
two living genera; namely, the <i>Lepidosteus</i>, of which there
are many species that inhabit the rivers of America; and
the <i>Polypterus</i>, that contains two species, one inhabiting the
Nile, and the other the rivers of Senegal. In these fishes
the bones of the skull are closely connected by sutures; the
teeth are large, conical, and longitudinally striated, as in
the crocodile, plesiosaurus, &amp;c.; the spinous processes are
united to the bodies of the vertebr&aelig; by suture, as in most
reptiles; and the ribs are articulated to the extremities of
the transverse processes; the skeleton is osseous. Even in
the soft parts many analogies to reptilian structure are
seen; thus the Lepidosteus has a glottis, as in the <i>Siren</i>;
and a cellular air-bladder, with a tracheal vessel, resembling
the lungs of an Ophidian (<i>serpent</i>). These fishes are the
only living representatives of those voracious tribes of the
most ancient marine fauna, whose remains abound in the
Secondary formations. Their relics have often been mistaken
for those of reptiles; particularly the teeth, which from
their large size, conical figure, enamelled and striated surface,
and internal cavity, were generally supposed to belong
to crocodiles. The scales are flat, rhomboidal, and parallel
to the body. The recent <i>Lepidosteus osseus</i>, of North
America, affords a good illustration of the fossil genera; a
reduced figure of this fish, from <i>Poiss. Foss.</i>, will be found in
<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxvii<sup><i>a</i></sup>.; and teeth of some fossil Sauroids are represented
<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxvii.</p>

<p>The teeth of the Sauroids consist of two kinds; namely,
large pointed striated cones, and numerous small brush-teeth.
The intricate structure of the conical teeth of the
<i>Stony-gar</i>, or Lepidosteus, is very remarkable, and presents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616"> 616 </a></span>
some analogy to that observable in the dental organs of the
Labyrinthodon, an extinct genus of reptiles, of which we
shall treat in a subsequent chapter. The tooth consists of
a large conical pulp-cavity, surrounded by a mass of dentine,
which is plicated longitudinally, its folds giving to the pulp-cavity
an appearance of being divided into parallel longitudinal
branches; resembling, in this respect, the base of
the tooth of Ichthyosaurus, as shown in a transverse section,
<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 9</i></a>. If we imagine these folds to be multiplied,
and to have more inflections, and the pulp-cavity to be
reduced in its proportions, we shall have the elegant organization
of the teeth of the <i>Labyrinthodonts</i> (see <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI.
fig. 3b</i></a>). The dentine is composed of very minute calcigerous
tubes, which pass off at right angles from the pulp-cavity
to the periphery; and it is covered by a layer of
cement, or coarser dentine, which is encased in a coat of
enamel, forming the external investment of the tooth.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> The
long conical teeth are implanted in <i>alveoli</i> or sockets, to the
walls of which they are anchylosed at their base.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_549" id="Footnote_549"></a><a href="#FNanchor_549"><span class="label">[549]</span></a> These remarks are based on M. Agassiz&#8217;s description and my
own observations. An interesting paper, "On the Microscopic
Structure of the Teeth of the <i>Lepidostei</i>, and their analogy with those
of the <i>Labyrinthodonts</i>, with a plate," by <i>Dr. Jeffries Wyman</i>, will be
found in Amer. Journ. of Science, October, 1843, p. 359.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lepidostei.</span>&mdash;This family, having the above described
recent <i>Lepidosteus</i> for its type, comprises several genera, and
is represented in all the formations from the Tertiary to the
Coal-measures inclusive. The <i>Lepidosteus</i> itself has left its
remains in the Eocene tertiary of England. The Lepidotus
(before described, <a href="#Page_604">p. 604</a>,) ranges from the Chalk to the
Lias; the <i>Pholidophorus</i> and <i>Dapedius</i> (<a href="#Page_603">p. 603</a>) abound in
the Lias; the latter being found also in the Wealden,
and the former in the Oolite and Purbeck; and the <i>Pal&aelig;oniscus</i>
(see <a href="#Page_601">p. 601</a>) is a well-known Permian and Carboniferous
form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617"> 617 </a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sauroidei.</span>&mdash;The remains of the Sauroids proper occur
in the Chalk, Purbeck, Oolite, Lias, Permian, and Carboniferous
rocks. The great strength and size of some of
these teeth prove that the seas of those remote periods were
inhabited by voracious fishes of enormous magnitude. See
<i>Petrif.</i> pp. 432, <i>et seq.</i></p>

<p>The teeth and jaw of a gigantic sauroid (<i>Megalichthys</i>),
from the Carboniferous strata at Burdie-house, are figured
<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxvii.; the sections of the teeth shown in figs. 13,
14, of that plate, illustrate the size of the pulp-cavity and
the thickness of the layer of dentine. These remains were
associated with the plants and crustaceans previously described;
an assemblage of fossils indicating a lacustrine or
estuary formation. Similar teeth have been found in the
cannel-coal of Fifeshire.</p>

<p>In the Upper Lias of Ilminster, Somerset, the nodular
calcareous rock is rich with the remains of the <i>Pachycormus</i>,
many fine specimens of which Mr. C. Moore, of that
town, has successfully worked out from their stony encasement,
exhibiting the gaping, contorted fish, as it died in
the convulsive throes of suffocation in the muddy sea. The
little sauroid <i>Leptolepis</i>, of the Lias and the Purbeck, is also
abundant in the above mentioned locality.</p>

<p>In the lithographic stone of Solenhofen, and in the Purbeck
strata, Oxford Clay, and Lias of England, occur specimens
of a sauroid fish remarkable for the extreme shortness
of the lower jaw, and the prolongation of the upper into
a beak; it is named <i>Aspidorhynchus</i> by Agassiz. The figure
of this fossil fish is contrasted on pl. xxvii<sup><i>a</i></sup>. <i>Bd.</i> with that
of its recent ally, the <i>Lepidosteus</i>.</p>

<p>In the Shanklin sand and in the Galt of Kent and
Sussex, large, conical, striated teeth belonging to sauroid
fishes are occasionally found. They invariably occur detached,
and no portion of the jaws has been observed. In
the Chalk of Sussex several fine sauroid fishes have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618"> 618 </a></span>
discovered; such as the <i>Lophiostomus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> <i>Belonostomus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> and
<i>Caturus</i>; the last two of which are found in the Oolite and
Lias also. These have been described and figured in the late
Mr. Dixon&#8217;s "Geology and Fossils of Sussex."</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Sauroidei-dipterini</span><a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> are found almost exclusively
in the Devonian formation. <i>Osteolepis</i>, <i>Diplopterus</i>, and
<i>Dipterus</i> are characteristic members of this family. Interesting
descriptions and instructive figures of the structure
of these genera are given in Mr. Hugh Miller&#8217;s late work,
"Foot-prints of the Creator, or the Asterolepis of Stromness,"
at pp. 50 to 61.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><span class="smcap">C&#339;lacanthi.</span>&mdash;This is a numerous family of sauroid
fishes, that have derived their name, <i>hollow-spine</i>, from the
central cavity in the fin-rays, which, however, may have
had originally cartilaginous cores. They are found from
the Devonian to the Cretaceous series. In the former, one
of the most remarkable is the genus <i>Holoptychius</i>, distinguished
by the peculiar structure of the scales; the enamelled
surface of which is covered by undulated furrows.
The whole body is covered by thick enamelled scales of this
kind. A splendid specimen, twenty-eight inches long, and
twelve wide, is figured <i>Murch. Sil. Syst.</i> pl. ii.<sup><i>bis.</i></sup> Scales
have been found exceeding three inches in length, by two
and a half in width; which must have belonged to a fish of
great magnitude. <i>Ly.</i> fig. 395.</p>

<p>In the Old Red Sandstone of Elgin, at a quarry at Scat-craig,
some peculiar teeth occur, which possess a very remarkable
structure, and have been referred to a genus of sauroid
fishes, which, from the dendritical or arborescent disposition
of the calcigerous tubes, Prof. Owen has named <i>Dendrodus</i>.
These teeth are of a conical form, slightly curved,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619"> 619 </a></span>
and solid throughout. On the external surface they are
finely striated longitudinally, and have two opposite vertical
ridges; the base is rough, and its margin rounded,
as if for attachment to a shallow socket. The largest specimen
is one and a half inch in length. In thin sections,
viewed microscopically by transmitted light, there is a
central pulp-cavity, of small size; the medullary canals
pass into a few short ramifications, like the branches of a
shrub, and these are distributed into irregular dilatations,
simulating leaves, which resolve themselves into radiating
bundles of calcigerous tubes; a portion of a transverse
section<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> is shown <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 8</i></a>.</p>

<p>In Mr. H. Miller&#8217;s charming work just referred to we
have a full and clear account of the singular fossil fish the
<span class="smcap">Asterolepis</span>. Remains of this gigantic Ganoid were first
found in Russia.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Its name is derived from the stellate
markings on the dermal plates of the head, which are of
great size, and form a strong expanded buckler, the orbits of
the eyes being situated near the anterior border. (See
Miller&#8217;s <i>Asterolepis</i>, pp. 74, <i>et seq.</i> figs. 27-29.) <a href="#lign_202"><i>Lign.</i> 202</a>
shows a part of the lower jaw of this fish, seen on the inside.
Along the upper margin are seen a "thickly set row of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620"> 620 </a></span>
small broadly-based teeth,"&mdash;these are ordinary <i>fish</i>-teeth;
and behind this edge-row of small teeth, <i>b</i>, there occur
"a thinly set row of huge <i>reptile</i>-teeth, based on an interior
platform of bone, which formed the top of the cartilage
enclosing box composing the jaw." (Miller.) These large
teeth, <i>a a</i>, are longitudinally striated, and generally bear two
sharp lateral cutting edges.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

fish is from one to two feet in length, of an elongated
fusiform shape, with a large head and two dorsal fins; the
anterior fin is imbedded, and has seven or eight strong
spinous rays, the first two of which have numerous spines.
The opercula are very long and large (hence its name); the
scales<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> are garnished with adpressed spines, disposed in semicircular
rows (see <a href="#lign_185"><i>Lign.</i> 185</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2). The teeth are small,
conical, and numerous.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Several specimens of this fish are almost perfect. The
bones of the cranium, the jaws, teeth, opercula, branchial
rays, palatine arches, the surface of the body covered with
scales, all the fins, the pelvic bones, the vertebr&aelig; and their
apophyses, all remain.</p>

<p>In one example, the vomer, covered with minute teeth,
is exposed. But the most extraordinary fact relating to
these Ichthyolites, is the preservation, in every specimen,
of the air-bladder;<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> even its membranes remain, and
separate in flakes; and the ramification of the minute
vessels is visible under a high magnifying power. In some
instances this bladder is displaced and much distended;
but in general it occupies its natural position, and retains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621"> 621 </a></span>
its elongated, sub-cylindrical form, with a few annular constrictions

<div class="sidenote">COPROLITES. COLOLITES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Coprolites.</span> <a href="#lign_139"><i>Lign.</i> 139</a>, <i>figs.</i> 1, 2.&mdash;In more than one
example the solid earthy residue of digestion, in small lumps
or pellets, of a conical form and spirally convoluted, lies in
the abdomen of these fossil fishes. Fossil excrementitious
substances of this kind are termed <i>Coprolites</i> (<i>Bd.</i> p. 198,
pl. xv.); they occur in many deposits, and belong not only
to fishes, but to large reptiles and other animals. <a href="#lign_139"><i>Lign.</i> 139</a>,
 p. 432, <i>fig.</i> 1, represents the coprolite of a <i>Macropoma</i>;
and <i>fig.</i> 2, that of a species of <i>Shark</i>, from Hamsey. The
convoluted appearance of these bodies arises from the
peculiar organization of the intestinal canal of the original
fishes, in which, as in the recent Dog-fish, a portion of the
intestine was spirally twisted, the tube forming several
gyrations; and the passage of the calcareous substance
through this constricted canal gave rise to the structure
observable in the coprolites. In the Macropoma the
gyrations appear to have been few; seldom more than five
or six turns being apparent. In the fossil Sharks the convolutions
are more numerous, ten or twelve occurring in
the length of an inch. In many of the coprolites, the impression
of the mucous or lining membrane of the intestinal
canal may be detected. Some of the coprolites of the
Macropoma are not convoluted; probably from having
occupied the upper part of the digestive tube, and therefore
not having been moulded in the spiral part. (See <i>Geol.
S. E.</i> p. 145. <i>Foss. South D.</i> tab. ix.) Minute scales and
bones of fishes are occasionally imbedded in the substance
of the coprolites, affording evidence of the carnivorous habits
of the Macropoma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cololites.</span> <i>Bd.</i> pl. xv<sup><i>a</i></sup>&mdash;It will be convenient to notice
in this place those curious fossils which occur in detached
masses in the limestone of Solenhofen, and used to be
known to collectors by the term <i>lumbricaria</i>, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622"> 622 </a></span>
supposition that they were petrified earth-worms. An
excellent representation of a fine specimen is given by Dr.
Buckland in the plate referred to above. These convoluted
bodies M. Agassiz, with his wonted sagacity, has ascertained
to be the intestines of fishes; and has therefore named
them <i>Cololites</i>. Although generally found isolated, specimens
occur in which they are imbedded, like the coprolites
of the Macropoma, in the abdominal region of fishes.
The frequent occurrence of the <i>Cololites</i> apart from the
body, is explained by the usual process of decomposition in
fishes. M. Agassiz remarks that dead fish always float on
the surface of the water with the belly uppermost, until the
abdomen bursts from distention. The small intestines are
then expelled by the evolved gases through the aperture,
and soon become detached from the body. I have observed
indistinct traces of similar remains in the beds of chalk in
which fossil fishes most prevail. Dr. Buckland mentions
the discovery, by Lord Greenock, of a mass of petrified
intestines distended with coprolite, and surrounded by the
scales of a fish, in a block of coal-shale from the neighbourhood
of Edinburgh (<i>Bd.</i> p. 199).</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dercetis elongatus.</span> <i>Wond.</i> p. 349.&mdash;Before proceeding
to the investigation of examples of the next order, I will
describe a highly interesting Ichthyolite, which in a mutilated
state is extremely common in some of the chalk strata
of the South-east of England; it is noticed in <i>Foss. South D.</i>
p. 232. This fish is placed by M. Agassiz in his family of
ganoidians, termed <i>Scleroderms</i>; and he mentions that
another species has been found in the chalk of Westphalia.
The <i>Dercetis</i> has a very elongated body, with a short head
terminating in a pointed beak; the upper jaw is a little
longer than the lower, and both jaws are armed with long,
conical, elevated teeth, and several rows of very small ones.
On each side of the fish there are three rows of osseous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623"> 623 </a></span>
scutcheons like those of the Sturgeon (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 349);
the body was also covered with numerous small scales.
From the form of the body somewhat resembling that of
the eel, being very long, and sub-cylindrical in uncompressed
examples, the specimens are generally called
"<i>petrified eels</i>" by the quarry-men. The examples usually
found consist of the elongated body, more or less compressed,
and irregularly covered with patches of scales confusedly
intermingled; among which traces of the scutcheons
may sometimes be distinguished. These specimens occasionally
exceed two feet in length, by one or two inches in
breadth; with neither extremity perfect, and without any
vestige of the fins.<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> The example figured <i>Wond.</i> <i>Lign.</i> 74, is
the only instance in which I have seen the cranium perfect.
The scutcheons in the Westphalian species have a prominent
longitudinal ridge or keel, and their surface finely
granulated; they are so large that the whole body of the
fish is covered with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CTENOID FISHES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Ctenoid Fishes</span> (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. iv.).&mdash;The
fishes of this order have imbricated laminated scales, the
posterior margins of which are round and finely pectinated;
<i>i. e.</i> divided into little teeth, like a comb. These scales are
nearly circular, but more or less elongated; and, as the
lamin&aelig; of which they are composed successively diminish
from the lowermost to the uppermost, the pectinated
margin of each being apparent, the surface is very scabrous;
the front edge is sinuous. The common <span class="smcap">Perch</span> is the type
of the Ctenoidians. The teeth of these fishes are invariably
small, and either villous or brush-like.</p>

<p>From the numerous fossil genera I select, in illustration
of the characters of this order, the <i>Beryx</i>; of which four
species occur in the English Chalk, and three others in the
Chalk of Bohemia and Westphalia. Of this genus, which
is closely related to the Perch (<i>Perca</i>), two living species
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624"> 624 </a></span>
inhabit the seas of Australia. The bones of the skull have
dentated crests; the dorsal fin has spinous rays in front,
which are united to the soft rays; the margin of the
caudal fin has little spinous rays.</p>

<p>The Beryx is one of the most ancient representatives of
the Perch tribe, and of the Ctenoid order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beryx Lewesiensis.</span><a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> <i>Wond.</i> p. 351; <i>Petrif.</i> <i>Lign.</i> 90.&mdash;This
is one of the most common of the Ichthyolites of
the Chalk of the South-east of England; it is called
"<i>Johnny Dory</i>" by the quarry-men; the specimens are
from six to twelve inches long. It occurs also in the Chalk
of Westphalia. The outline of the perfect form of this
species, <i>Wond.</i> p. 351, by Mr. Dinkel, conveys an accurate
idea of its external characters. It has one dorsal fin, with
several spinous rays in front of the soft ray. The head is
very large, and the opercular pieces are ornamented with
sculptured rays; the margins of the jaws are covered with
a broad band of brush-teeth. The orbit is large, and often
contains the capsule (<i>sclerotica</i>) of the eye. The rays of the
gills are short and thick, five are preserved in some examples.
The scales are very large; about twenty-five in the median
row; their posterior margins have several concentric rows
of spines (see <a href="#lign_185"><i>Lign.</i> 185</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3, p. 567). The lateral line is
often distinctly apparent, in the form of a tube, contracted
behind and expanded in the centre of the scale. The
vertebral column is composed of large short vertebr&aelig;, with
very long apophyses; the ribs are slight.</p>

the scales having a polished or glossy aspect. The scales
are small, with a simple row of diverging spines on the
posterior edge. The scales of the lateral line are peculiar;
the mucous canal is not formed of a series of simple tubular
cylinders, as in <i>B. Lewesiensis</i>, but is divided into several
branches, as may be seen with a lens of moderate power.
There are more than thirty scales in the length of the
lateral line.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beryx microcephalus</span> (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. iv. tab. iv<sup><i>c</i></sup>.;
and Dixon, <i>Foss. Sussex</i>, tab. xxiv. <i>fig.</i> 3).&mdash;This fish is distinguished
by its slender form, and the extreme smallness
of the head, as the name implies. The scales have one row
of very thick spines on the posterior margin; they are
more elevated, and shorter than in <i>B. radians</i>; those of the
lateral line are pierced by an elongated conical tube, and are
not ramified as in the last species. This ichthyolite, like
the <i>B. radians</i>, occurs in the Chalk-marl, and in a similar
state of mineralization.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smerdis minutus.</span> <a href="#lign_203"><i>Lign.</i> 203</a>.&mdash;A pretty ctenoidian fish,
from one to three inches long, about the dimensions of a
perch a year old, is very common in the marls of Aix
in Provence, <i>Wond.</i> p. 260; and many are often found
grouped together in every variety of position. This species
is characterised by the elevated anterior rays of the dorsal,
and the wide and very forked caudal fin.</p>

<p>Several ctenoidian and cycloidian fishes have been found
in the north of the Brazils, by Mr. Gardiner, in strata
probably of the Cretaceous epoch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Cycloid Fishes.</span> (<i>Poiss. Foss.</i> tom. v.)&mdash;This order
comprises the fishes possessing scales of a cycloid, or circular,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626"> 626 </a></span>
form, with smooth margins, and composed of plates
of horn or bone, without enamel. It contains numerous
families, including the <i>Scaroids</i>, or Parrot-fishes, and the
<i>Scomberoids</i>, or Mackerel tribe, which are Acanthopterygians,
the <i>Lucioids</i>, or Pikes, <i>Clupeoids</i>, or Herrings, <i>Salmonoids</i>,
or Salmon tribe, and the <i>Cyprinoids</i>, or Carps,
which are Malacopterygians, as well as other families. The
fossil remains of this order are exceedingly numerous, particularly
in the Tertiary and upper Secondary deposits. A
genus of <i>Salmonid&aelig;</i>, discovered in the White Chalk of
Sussex, will serve to exemplify the characters of the fossil
cycloidian fishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Osmeroides.</span> <i>Plate II.</i> and <i>Wond.</i> p. 344, 347.&mdash;Two
species of this genus occur in the Chalk, near Lewes; and
principally, if not exclusively, in the Lower Chalk, without
flints. They are exceedingly beautiful Ichthyolites, and are
almost invariably found with the body but little compressed;
the fish, in many examples, is as round and perfect
as when living. The entire cranium, the opercula and
branchial rays, and all the fins are preserved in some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627"> 627 </a></span>
examples. These fishes belong to the Salmon family,<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a>
and are nearly related to the <span class="smcap">Smelt</span> (<i>Osmerus</i>); whence the
name of the genus. There are two species, easily distinguishable.
The first (<i>O. Mantelli</i>, <a href="#Plate_II"><i>Pl. II.</i></a>) has a short, sub-cylindrical
body, and seldom exceeds eight or nine inches in
length; the other (<i>O. Lewesiensis</i>) has an elongated and
elliptical body, and sometimes attains a length of fourteen
inches. The dorsal fin too in this species has more rays
than in the other. The fossil figured in <a href="#Plate_II"><i>Pl. II.</i></a>. is a very
remarkable specimen of the first species. It is nine inches
in length; and the chalk has been cleared away, so as to
expose the entire fish, six inches in relief above the surface
of the block, <i>Petrif.</i> <i>Lign.</i> 92, p. 445. The fish is lying on
its back, with the mouth open, and the opercula, or gill-covers,
and the branchial arches expanded; the pectoral
and ventral fins, and the dorsal fin, are in their natural
position; the five rays of the dorsal are erect; of the
caudal fin, or tail, but slight indications remain. There is
but one dorsal fin; but in a specimen of <i>O. Lewesiensis</i>
there is a trace of the little adipose process observable
between the dorsal fin and the tail, as in the recent species
of <i>Salmonid&aelig;</i>. A magnified view of one of the scales is
represented <a href="#lign_185"><i>Lign.</i> 185</a>, <i>fig.</i> 4, p. 567.</p>

xxxiii. and xl. as <i>Salmo Lewesiensis</i>.</p></div>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Cyprinoids</span>, or fishes of the Carp family (Malacopterygians),
the recent species of which are inhabitants
either of fresh-water, or the brackish waters of the mouths
of rivers, many fossil species occur in the fluviatile and
lacustrine deposits of the Tertiary formations. In their
character of omnivorous fishes, the Carps then, as now,
formed the principal mass of the finny population of the
lakes, and in their turn served as food to the carnivorous
tribes, as the pikes, eels, &amp;c. Several species are found in
a beautiful state in the schists of &#338;ningen, and in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628"> 628 </a></span>
Tertiary marls at Aix. Many of the layers of marl at the
latter locality are covered with groups of fishes of the family
<i>Cyprinodonts</i>, the recent species of which are of a small size,
and inhabit the fresh-water lakes of temperate zones. <a href="#lign_184"><i>Lign.</i>
184</a>, p. 562, represents a portion of a large slab of marl in
the cabinet of Sir R. Murchison, which is covered with
scores of a species resembling a recent fish (<i>Lebias</i>) in the
profile of its head, and the form of its fins. It is named
<span class="smcap">Lebias cephalotes</span>, from the relative largeness of its head.
The black appearance of the abdomen in many of these
Ichthyolites indicates the original situation of the intestines
and of the liver, which is largely developed in the fishes of
this family, and contains much colouring matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saurocephalus and Saurodon.</span> <a href="#lign_204"><i>Lign.</i> 204</a>.&mdash;In the
same quarry, near Lewes, from which the first entire fish of
the Sussex Chalk was obtained, teeth of a very peculiar
character were, many years since, occasionally discovered.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a>
These teeth are of a lanceolate form, much compressed;
with entire, sharp edges, terminating in a point; the fang
is single, and broad; the surface of the crown is glossy, and
marked with fissures filled with chalk (see <a href="#lign_204"><i>Lign.</i> 204</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1).
Teeth of this kind, attached to portions of the jaw, were
subsequently found in the Chalk at Brighton and Lewes.
Similar remains were collected from the Cretaceous marls
of Missouri and New Jersey, in the United States. The
American specimens comprised two closely allied genera,
which, from the supposition that the fossils were the relics
of reptiles, were respectively designated <i>Saurocephalus</i> and
<i>Saurodon</i>.<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> Examples of the teeth and jaws of both

<p>M. Agassiz retains the names imposed by the American
naturalists, and has placed these genera in the family of
Scomberoids (<i>Mackerel</i>, <i>Swordfish</i>). They belong to the
<i>Pharyngognathi</i> of Muller. The teeth are disposed in a
single row, and fixed in deep sockets by a simple root, or
fang, which is frequently somewhat excavated by the
pressure of a successional tooth. In <i>Saurodon Leanus</i> the
crown of the tooth is angular, and barbed, and supported on
a sub-cylindrical shank, or stem (see <a href="#lign_204"><i>Lign.</i> 204</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3). The
microscopical structure of these teeth presents that peculiar
reticulated disposition of the medullary canals throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630"> 630 </a></span>
the entire body of the tooth, which is only found in the
dental organs of fishes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hypsodon Lewesiensis.</span> (<i>Foss. South D.</i> tab. xlii.)&mdash;The
Sussex and Kentish Chalk also contain the remains of
a very large fish, belonging to the Pharyngognathi, with
extremely upright, long, conical, compressed, pointed teeth,
which, like those of the Saurodon, are implanted in sockets.
These teeth are commonly of a delicate fawn colour externally
and of a dark brown internally; having a large
simple pulp-cavity. In <i>Foss. South D.</i> (tab. xlii.) are represented
portions of an intermaxillary and jaw-bone with
teeth; a vertebra, deeply biconcave; and a large bone,
apparently a branch of the <i>os hyoides</i>; all found in the

portion of the lower jaw, with one row of elongated, conical,
slightly curved, pointed teeth; the two anterior teeth being
much longer and larger than the others; it affords a good
illustration of the dental organs of <i>Enchodus</i>; a genus of
Acanthopterygian fishes, the jaws and teeth of which are
often found in the Sussex Chalk. The teeth are of various
sizes, and attached by anchylosis, one row on the premandibular
bone, and another irregular row of smaller teeth to
the inside of the lower jaw. The two anterior teeth are
very large, and of a peculiar form: their base is wide and
solid, and the shank of the tooth is suddenly contracted immediately
above, and becomes elongated into a point. These
teeth are generally of a dark colour, have a glossy aspect,
and are very brittle; differing so remarkably in this respect
from the shark&#8217;s teeth, with which they are usually collocated,
that mere fragments can be readily identified. The

<p>Mr. Toulmin Smith, of Highgate, has in his Museum
a portion of the lower jaw with fifteen teeth of a small
individual, imbedded in the centre of a flint nodule, from
Gravesend, which was discovered by accidentally breaking
the stone. The bone of the jaw and the teeth are of a dead
white colour, and appear not to be in the slightest degree
silicified; but in those teeth which are broken the pulp-cavity
is filled with quartz, which must have transuded
through the walls of the teeth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ichthyolites of recent species.</span>&mdash;The distinguished
naturalist to whose labours in fossil Ichthyology we have
been so largely indebted, states, that of the many hundred
species submitted to his notice, but one can be identified
with any fish now living. This conclusion must, however,
be received with some reservation; for, among the fossil
genera, founded on the teeth, there are species which certainly
cannot be distinguished from recent forms. And in
the diluvial drift at Breslau, associated with the bones of the
fossil elephant (<i>Elephas primigenius</i>), the remains of a pike,
closely resembling the common European species, have lately
been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ichthyopatolites</span>, or imprints of the pectoral fin-rays
of certain fishes. Under this name Dr. Buckland described
certain problematical markings observed on a flag-stone from
a coal-pit at Mostyn, in Flintshire, and now in the Geological
Society&#8217;s Museum. It consists of curvilinear scratches or
imprints, disposed symmetrically at regular intervals on
each side a smooth level space, about two inches wide,
which may correspond to the body of a fish, the pectoral
fins of which Dr. Buckland suggests were the instruments
by which the markings in question were formed.</p>

<p>These scratches follow each other in nearly equidistant
rows of three in a row, and at intervals of about two inches
from the point of each individual scratch to the points of
those next succeeding and preceding it; they are slightly
convex outwards, three on each side the median space, or
supposed track of the body of the fish. Dr. Buckland, in
the memoir referred to, shows that these markings cannot
be referable to the imprint of the feet or claws of reptiles,
and points out the structure of the bony anterior rays of the
pectoral fins, as in certain Siluroid and Lophoid fishes, and in
the Climbing Perch (<i>Anabas scandens</i>), or the <i>Hassar</i> (<i>Doras
costata</i>), and refers also to the ambulatory movements of the

<p><i>Geological Distribution of Fossil Fishes.</i>&mdash;From the
incidental notices of the geological habitats of the fossil
fishes enumerated in our survey of this class of beings, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633"> 633 </a></span>
reader cannot fail to have remarked, that the most recent
strata abounded in forms related to the inhabitants of the
existing seas and rivers; while the most ancient teemed
with species and genera of families altogether extinct, or of
prodigious rarity in the recent fauna.</p>

<p>In general terms, it may be stated, upon the authority
of M. Agassiz, that the Ichthyolites of the Tertiary deposits
approach in their characters to the living genera, but all the
species are extinct. The newer Tertiary, as the Crag, contain
genera common to tropical seas, as the large sharks
(<i>Carcharias</i>), and eagle-rays (<i>Myliobates</i>), &amp;c. In the
Eocene, or most ancient Tertiary, as the London and Paris
basins, Monte Bolca, &amp;c., many of the Ichthyolites are
closely related to recent genera. Of the Chalk fishes, a few
only are of recent genera, but the majority are still allied
to Tertiary forms. In the Chalk, the <i>Pharyngognathi</i>,
<i>Acanthopteri</i>, and <i>Malacopteri</i> are met with as new types;
and indications of the <i>Hybodontid&aelig;</i>, <i>Sauroidei</i>, and <i>C&#339;lacanthi</i>
(the last derived from the Devonian, and the other
two from the Carboniferous Limestone) appear for the
last time.</p>

<p>The ichthyic fauna of the Cretaceous deposits is closely
related by the majority of its <i>family</i> groups with that of the
series of strata from the Lias to the Wealden, inclusive.
In and above the Lias all the ganoid fishes are <i>homocercal</i>.
Below the Lias, the genera and species are far more removed
from existing types, and almost all are <i>heterocercal</i>.</p>

<p>Of the eight thousand living fishes known to naturalists,
three-fourths belong to the Cycloid and Ctenoid
orders, and of these no species are known below the Chalk;
the other fourth is referable to the Placoids and Ganoids,
of which there are comparatively but few existing species.
Yet fishes of these two orders almost solely flourished
during the ancient Secondary formations; for below the
Lias, the predominant recent orders are altogether absent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634"> 634 </a></span>
Beneath the Coal, true carnivorous fishes, with trenchant
teeth, are almost unknown; but omnivorous species, with
either brush or obtusely conical teeth, and great sauroid
fishes, are the prevailing representatives of the class.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a>
In fine, the Ichthyolites of the different formations constitute
two grand groups, which have their boundary line
at the base of the Cretaceous deposits. The first and
most ancient comprises the Ganoids and Placoids; the
second, more intimately related to existing types, comprehends
forms more diversified; these are principally Ctenoid
and Cycloid, with a small number of the two preceding
orders, which insensibly disappear; and their few living
analogues are very distinct from the ancient species. Now,
although deductions of this nature may require to be
modified with the progress of knowledge, yet the generalizations
thus obtained are founded on so vast an accumulation
of facts and observations, as to render it improbable
that they will be materially invalidated by future discoveries;
for they remarkably accord with the results derived
from the investigation of the fossil remains of all the other
classes of animals. The most modern deposits contain the
remains of animals allied to the existing species; the most
ancient, of forms altogether extinct, or of excessive rarity in
the recent faunas. The discovery of existing species, or
genera, in the most ancient strata, would modify, but not
destroy, the inferences deduced from the facts hitherto
obtained; and every geologist is prepared to find that such
may be the case.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_569" id="Footnote_569"></a><a href="#FNanchor_569"><span class="label">[569]</span></a> In the several chapters on the different formations, as arranged
in the <i>Wonders</i>, the student will find succinct notices of the distribution
of the <i>genera</i> of fishes throughout the fossiliferous deposits.
A list of the Chalk species known in 1848 is given at pp. 356-359,
<i>Wond.</i></p></div>

<p>Thus of the Sharks, with triangular notched teeth, which
are so common in the Tertiary formations, and were formerly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635"> 635 </a></span>
unknown in the ancient Secondary, one representative
has been found in the Carboniferous system (see <a href="#Page_595">p. 595</a>).
But, if teeth of this type should hereafter be discovered
in every Secondary deposit, the great preponderance
of these fishes over the Sauroid in the Tertiary, and in the
existing seas, would not be the less remarkable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">On Collecting and Developing Fossil Fishes.</span>&mdash;From
what has been advanced, the reader will have obtained a
general knowledge of the fossil remains of this class that are
likely to be met with in particular deposits. Thus, he will
expect to find the teeth of large sharks and rays in the
Tertiary clays and sands; and skeletons and perfect specimens
of numerous Ctenoid and Cycloid fishes in the
laminated marls and fine limestones of the same formations.
In the Chalk, with numerous teeth of sharks, he may discover
splendid examples of Cycloid and Ctenoid fishes; and,
in the Wealden, large Ganoidian forms. Passing to the
ancient Secondary strata, the extraordinary buckler-headed
and Sauroid fishes will arrest his attention; and their
vestiges will be found, more or less perfect, in the shales
and limestones, and in the indurated nodules of clay and
sandstone.</p>

<p>The detached teeth of fishes in Tertiary sands and clays
may be easily obtained entire, and should be arranged in
the same manner as the shells (see <a href="#Page_442">p. 442</a>), either in trays,
or on boards. The triangular teeth, with lateral denticles,
must be carefully extracted, so as to preserve those appendages
on which the specific and generic distinctions of many
Ichthyolites depend. M. Agassiz particularly recommends
the preservation of all the specimens collected together in
the same locality, as many may probably belong to the
same individual, and thus the dental organization of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636"> 636 </a></span>
original be determined. Teeth collected from the same
stratum in different places, should not, therefore, be mixed
together. Several series of the same kind of teeth should
be preserved, and as many as possible of each kind; for
specimens apparently identical may prove to be highly
instructive as a series. I have often had occasion to regret
the disposal of supposed duplicates, in my earlier researches,
which would have tended to elucidate the characters of
those specimens which were retained.</p>

<p>The Ichthyolites, and their detached teeth and fins, in the
Chalk and other soft limestones, may be cleared by means
of a penknife or graver and small sharp chisels. It is preferable
to leave the teeth attached to small blocks of the
chalk; as in the examples, figured <a href="#lign_193"><i>Lign.</i> 193</a>. But to
develop the beautiful Chalk Ichthyolites, particularly those
of the Osmeroides, Macropoma, &amp;c. some practice and considerable
dexterity are required. The compressed fishes, as
the Beryx, like those in the Tertiary limestones, often lie in
the sedimentary plane of the stone, and may be sufficiently
exposed, by a blow of a hammer or a pick, to show the
nature of the fossil, and admit of being easily developed.
But the fishes with sub-cylindrical bodies very commonly
split asunder in a transverse direction: and those with
spinous scales, as the Macropoma, adhere so firmly to the
chalk, that, to display the external surface of their scales,
the surrounding stone must be removed piecemeal, in the
manner described for the Chalk crustaceans (see <a href="#Page_544">p. 544</a>). The
collector who sees the splendid Chalk fishes in the British
Museum,<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> and learns that they were found in the Chalk of
Kent and Sussex, will be grievously disappointed, upon
visiting the quarries from which they were obtained, if he
expects to discover specimens with any considerable portion
of the scales, or body, exposed. It was many years before
the quarry-men acquired the tact they now possess, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637"> 637 </a></span>
detecting, from very slight evidence, the presence of an
Ichthyolite in a block of chalk: patches of scales, which
the quarry-men called "<i>bran</i>," and detached sharks&#8217; teeth,
"<i>birds beaks</i>," and "<i>snakes' tongues</i>," and teeth of Ptychodus,
"<i>slugs</i>," being the only remains of fishes generally observed
and laid aside by the workmen.</p>

<p>The fossil <i>Salmon</i> or <i>Smelt</i> (see <a href="#Page_626">p. 626</a>), which may be
considered as one of the most extraordinary of the Chalk
fishes found in England, affords an excellent illustration of
the mode of developing the Ichthyolites of this formation.
This interesting fossil is delineated on a small scale, in three
different states, in <i>Plate II.</i>; and affords a good practical
lesson for the young collector. Among some blocks of chalk
which a recent fall in one of the quarries near Lewes had
brought to light, was a large mass split asunder, and exposing
on each corresponding surface an irregular oval
marking of a yellowish brown colour; this appearance is
represented <a href="#Plate_II"><i>Pl. II. fig. 1</i></a>. Presuming that these markings
were produced by a transverse section of the body of a fish,
the two blocks were trimmed into a portable size, and accurately
cemented together with very <i>hot, thin, fresh</i> glue.
When consolidated, some of the chalk was chiselled off in
the supposed longitudinal direction of the enclosed fish, and
part of the body, covered with scales, was exposed, as <a href="#Plate_II"><i>Pl. II.
fig. 2</i></a>. With the view of ascertaining the extent of the
Ichthyolite, some of the surrounding stone was then removed
towards each extremity of the block, and traces of
the fish were discovered, as shown in the same figure. The
task of completely developing the fossil was thus rendered
comparatively easy; the chalk was chiselled, cut, and
scraped away, till the perfect fish, as seen in <i>fig.</i> 3, was developed.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a>
The block was then reduced to a convenient size,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638"> 638 </a></span>
and the edges sawn smooth. The chalk is easily cut with
a carpenter&#8217;s saw; the instrument should be short and
strong, and the teeth of moderate size.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_571" id="Footnote_571"></a><a href="#FNanchor_571"><span class="label">[571]</span></a> The figure in <a href="#Plate_II"><i>Pl. II.</i></a> is too small to convey an accurate idea of
this Ichthyolite, which is now in the British Museum; see <i>Petrifactions</i>,
pp. 445, 446. M. Agassiz&#8217;s figure very inaccurately represents
the original. A beautiful lithograph of this fish, by Mr. Pollard, of
Brighton, was published in the Catalogue of the Mantellian Museum,
1836.</p></div>

<p>When a <i>portion</i> of the body of an Ichthyolite of this
kind is found in a block of chalk, and the fracture of the
block appears to be recent, diligent search should be made
for the corresponding piece; for it may probably be found
to contain the other part of the fish. A splendid specimen
of <i>Osmeroides Lewesiensis</i>, more than a foot long, was thus
obtained. The quarry-men, in a block of chalk which a
recent fall had thrown down, discovered a few inches of the
caudal portion of the body of a fish; on the broken surface
of the stone, a section of the body was distinctly seen, as
in the specimen previously described. Search was made
among the fallen masses for the corresponding piece, but
without success. Upon observing the face of the quarry
exposed by the recent fall, on a projecting block, many yards
above our reach, a discoloured spot was indistinctly seen,
and it was conjectured that this might prove to be the other
moiety of the Ichthyolite. The workmen were directed to
preserve this block if possible; but it remained <i>in situ</i>
several months, and until the rock was again blasted; when
the stone so long coveted rolled away from the fallen mass,
and fortunately was soon discovered. It proved to be the
corresponding portion of the fish; with the head, opercula,
branchial arches, pectoral fins, and the anterior part of the
body covered with beautiful cycloid scales. In the preparation
of fossils of this kind, glue as the cement, and a paste
made of plaster of Paris with thin glue, to fill up the crevices
and strengthen the block, are the materials I have employed.
The fossil remains of fishes in other rocks require
to be extracted and developed in the manner previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639"> 639 </a></span>
directed for the Echinoderms, Cephalopoda, &amp;c. (pp.
<a href="#Page_332">332</a>, <a href="#Page_497">497</a>.)</p>

<p>The collector may be reminded, that <i>Otolithes</i>, or ear-stones
(<a href="#Page_574">p. 574</a>), are found in the Crag of Norfolk, and other
Tertiary strata; and that Coprolites, associated with minute
scales, bones, &amp;c. of small fishes, constitute, in some localities,
layers of considerable thickness and of great extent.
The "<i>bone-bed</i>" of the Lias, near Westbury, and that of the
Ludlow series on the banks of the Teme, near Ludlow,<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> are
well-known examples of such a deposit.</p>

contents of this "bone-bed," in the Quart. Geol. Journ. vol. ix. p. 8</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Microscopical Examination.</span>&mdash;A few words on the
microscopical examination of the remains of fishes may be
useful. The structure of the large, and the forms of the
minute scales, may be seen by a common lens, and without
preparing the specimens. But for the examination of the
intimate organization of scales, teeth, &amp;c. the microscope is
required; and the method directed for the investigation of
flint (<a href="#Page_373">p. 373</a>) should be employed. The scales, portions of
the membranes of the air-bladder, stomach, &amp;c. and thin
chips of the teeth, rendered temporarily transparent by oil
of turpentine, or permanently so by Canada balsam, should
be viewed by transmitted light. But the intricate structure
of the dental organs, the medullary canals, and the calcigerous
tubes, cannot be successfully investigated without
the aid of the lapidary, or the adoption of the process
described at page 67 for the preparation of fossil wood for
microscopical examination.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_573" id="Footnote_573"></a><a href="#FNanchor_573"><span class="label">[573]</span></a> It is necessary to caution the collector against the frauds practised
by the quarry-men, and dealers in fossils, at this and other
celebrated foreign localities. Specimens, apparently perfect, are ingeniously
constructed from the fragments of various examples. The
head of one fish, the body of another, decorated with the fins of a
third, and perhaps the tail of a fourth, of different species, or even
genera, are dove-tailed together, coloured, and varnished, so as to
deceive the common observer, and, occasionally, even the experienced
collector. Sponging the specimens with cold water will often detect
the imposition; for the colour if artificial will be removed, or rendered
paler, while the same process will heighten the natural tints.
At Pappenheim, Solenhofen, and other places, where fossil crustaceans,
as Shrimps, Prawns, &amp;c. are found in such perfection, the
imprints of good specimens are often coloured, and offered for sale;
a wet sponge will speedily detect the imposture.</p>

the Fishes being the lowest in the scale amongst the beings

the various classes, orders, genera, and species, numerous

illustrious founder of Pal&aelig;ontology, in the quotation prefixed
to this chapter, that there was a period when the
lakes, rivers, and seas of our planet were peopled by reptiles,
and when cold-blooded oviparous quadrupeds, of appalling
magnitude, were the principal inhabitants of the dry lands,
was a proposition so novel and startling, as to require the
prestige of the name of <span class="smcap">Cuvier</span> to obtain for it any degree
of credence, even with those who were prepared to admit
that a universal deluge could not account for the physical
changes, which the crust of the earth had evidently undergone.
Subsequent observations and discoveries have, however,
fully confirmed the truth of this induction, and the
"<i>Age of Reptiles</i>" is no longer considered fabulous.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_576" id="Footnote_576"></a><a href="#FNanchor_576"><span class="label">[576]</span></a> "<i>The Age of Reptiles</i>" was the title given by the author to a
popular summary of the evidence bearing on this question: it was
published in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, 1831. This name
is now generally employed to designate the geological epochs characterised
by the predominance of oviparous quadrupeds; namely,
from the Permian to the Chalk, inclusive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645"> 645 </a></span></p></div>

<p>In some of the ancient fossiliferous deposits,<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> indications
of the existence of Reptiles are visible, in the indelible
markings left by their footsteps on the muddy banks of
rivers, and on the wet sands of the sea-shores, now in the
state of layers of marl and sandstone. Here and there in
the Devonian,<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Carboniferous, and New Red formations,
teeth and bones are found, presenting unequivocal proofs of
the presence of extinct forms of cold-blooded oviparous
quadrupeds. As we ascend in the secondary formations,
we are suddenly surrounded by innumerable marine and
terrestrial reptiles, belonging to species and genera, and
even orders, of which no living representatives are known.
Throughout the Liassic, Oolitic, Wealden, and Cretaceous
epochs, the class of Reptiles was at its fullest development.
In the Tertiary periods which succeeded, the Reptiles
approach the recent types, and their relics are found intermingled
with the bones of mammiferous quadrupeds; thus
indicating the commencement of the present condition and
relations of the animal kingdom. Referring the reader to
<i>Bd.</i> p. 165, and <i>Wond.</i> pp. 409-444 and 567-588, for
a more comprehensive view of this subject, we advance to
the examination of some of the fossil genera and species;
and we propose, in the first place, to explain a few essential
characters of form and structure observable in those durable
parts of the skeletons which are most frequently met with
in a fossil state; namely, the teeth, jaws, vertebr&aelig;, &amp;c.,
and the osseous appendages of the dermal system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth of Reptiles.</span>&mdash;The teeth of the animals of this
class exhibit considerable diversity of form, but the characteristic
type is that of a conical, pointed tooth, with a
simple root or fang; for, <i>in no reptile does the base of the
tooth terminate in more than one fang, and this is never
branched</i>. "Any fossil, therefore, which exhibits a tooth
implanted by two fangs in a double socket, must be mammiferous,
since the socketed teeth of reptiles have but a
single fang; and the only fishes&#8217; teeth which approach such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647"> 647 </a></span>
a tooth in form, are those of a bifurcate base, belonging to
certain sharks." (<i>Owen.</i>)</p>

<p>These dental organs are only fitted for seizing and retaining
the prey or food; for no living reptiles have the power
of performing mastication. In the Crocodiles the tooth
has a cylindrical shank, with a conical, longitudinally
striated, enamelled crown, having a ridge on each side
(<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 5</i></a>). In the <i>Labyrinthodon</i> (a fossil reptile),
the cone is more curved and pointed (<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 3</i></a>); in
the <i>Hyl&aelig;osaurus</i>, the shank is cylindrical, and the crown
expanded and lanceolate, with blunt margins (<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 6</i></a>);
in the <i>Megalosaurus</i>, the tooth is laterally compressed,
trenchant, and slightly inclined backwards like a sabre, with
serrated edges (<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 7</i></a>); in the <i>Iguanodon</i>, the shank
is cylindrical, and the crown of a prismatic form, greatly
expanded, with broad denticulated edges, and longitudinal
ridges on one side (<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 4</i></a>, and <i>Ligns.</i> <a href="#lign_221">221</a>, <a href="#lign_223">223</a>).
In the Serpents, the teeth are very long and pointed;
in the Crocodiles and Lizards, may be seen every modification
of the conical form, down to a mere hemispherical
tubercle or plate. In the fossil <i>Dicynodon</i>, to be hereafter
described, the dental system consists of but two tusks or
canine teeth, like those of the Walrus, implanted in the upper
jaw. The Turtles and some fossil Lacertians are edentulous,
<i>i. e.</i> destitute of teeth; their dental organs consisting of the
horny trenchant sheaths with which the jaws are covered.</p>

<p>The teeth are very numerous in reptiles; the individuals
of some species have more than two hundred. In some
genera, they are implanted on the jaws alone; in many,
they occupy the palatine, vomerine, and other bones composing
the vault of the mouth, as in certain fishes. The
teeth are generally anchylosed to the bone; but in some
genera they are implanted in distinct sockets, as in the
Crocodile and Plesiosaurus; in others, as in the Ichthyosaurus,
they are arranged in a deep furrow, and retained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648"> 648 </a></span>
only by the integuments; in some, they are supported upon
an elevated osseous base. In the Labyrinthodonts, and in
the greater part of the Serpent tribes, the tooth is implanted
by the base in a shallow socket, with which it is confluent.</p>

<p>In most of the Lacertians, or true Lizards, the attachment
of the teeth presents a peculiar modification, of which
the lower jaw of the Iguana, <a href="#lign_205"><i>Lign.</i> 205</a>, p. 649, affords a
good illustration. The teeth are not placed in sockets, but
are attached by the shank to an alveolar plate, or parapet,
that extends along the margin of the jaw, as shown in
<i>figs.</i> 1 and 3; the crowns of the teeth project above this
plate, as seen in <i>figs.</i> 2 and 4. From the anchylosis of
the teeth to the side of the jaw, the Lizards possessing this
dental structure are termed <i>Pleurodonts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_579" id="Footnote_579"></a><a href="#FNanchor_579"><span class="label">[579]</span></a> The <i>Pleurodonts</i> are those lizards in which the teeth are anchylosed
to the <i>side</i> of the dentary bone; <i>Acrodonts</i>, those with the teeth
fixed to the upper margin or <i>ridge</i> of the jaw-bone; <i>Thecodonts</i>,
those having the teeth implanted, either loosely, or anchylosed to
the walls of their sockets. Lacertians are also said to be <i>Pleodont</i>
(having solid teeth), or <i>C&#339;lodont</i> (hollow-toothed).</p></div>

<p>In reptiles, we have, therefore, five essential modifications
in the attachment of the teeth; namely, in distinct sockets;
in a continuous groove or furrow; attached laterally by the
shank to an alveolar parapet; anchylosed by the base to a
shallow socket; and attached to an osseous support, without
sockets or an alveolar plate.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a></p>

<p>The intimate structure of the teeth consists of a simple
pulp-cavity, surrounded by dentine, which is permeated by
extremely minute calcigerous tubes, radiating at right
angles to the periphery, or external surface of the tooth.
One essential modification of this structure consists in the intermingling
of cylindrical processes of the pulp-cavity, in the
form of medullary or vascular canals, with the finer tubular
structure; as in the tooth of the Iguanodon, <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. figs. 4b</i>
and <i>4c</i></a>. But another modification is that to which allusion
was made when describing the teeth of the Lepidosteus (see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650"> 650 </a></span>
<a href="#Page_616">p. 616</a>); in this mode, the dentine preserves its normal
character, but the external cement and surface of the tooth
are deeply inflected in longitudinal folds around the entire
circumference; and this structure is accompanied with corresponding
extensions of the pulp-cavity and dentine into
the interspaces of these inflected and converging folds.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a>
This organization is shown, in its simplest form, in the
transverse section of the base of a tooth of the Ichthyosaurus,
<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 9</i></a>; and attains its most complicated
condition in that of the Labyrinthodon, <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. figs. 3a,
3b, 3c</i></a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_581" id="Footnote_581"></a><a href="#FNanchor_581"><span class="label">[581]</span></a> There is a marked difference between the internal structure of
the teeth of true Saurians and of Sauroid Fishes. In the former, as
well as in the <i>Enaliosauria</i>, the dentine consists of tubes radiating
from a slender central pulp-cavity to the periphery of the tooth,
without any intermixture of vascular canals. In the sauroid fish
(<i>Dendrodus</i>) the central pulp-cavity is produced into numerous irregular
canals, from which vascular sinuses radiate to the periphery,
sending off branches generally at right angles throughout their entire
course; thus, there is an extensive distribution of the vascular system
through the body of the tooth, which does not exist in any saurian
reptile; the nearest analogy is in the labyrinthine teeth of the gigantic
fossil batrachians. (<i>Owen</i>: Odontography; and Art. <span class="smcap">Teeth</span>, Cyclop.
Anat.)</p></div>

<p>With regard to the mode of development of the teeth, we
must briefly state, that the germ of the new tooth is always
produced at the side of the base of the old one; that in its
progress of growth it presses against the tooth it is destined
to supplant, occasions the progressive absorption of the
fang, and ultimately displaces its predecessor; in some
instances, by splitting the crown of the tooth; in others,
by casting it off, according to the oblique or direct position
the new tooth attains in its progress, in relation to its predecessor.
Thus, in the teeth of the Crocodile, the new
tooth is generally found immediately under the conical
apex of the crown, and beneath the former a second successional
tooth appears, like a series of thimbles of various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651"> 651 </a></span>
sizes placed one upon another; for in reptiles the production
of new teeth is unlimited. But in the <i>Pleurodont</i> lizards,
the new tooth makes its way obliquely, and the crown is
often shed entire. <a href="#lign_205"><i>Lign.</i> 205</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3, exemplifies the situation
of the successional teeth in the Iguana.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lower Jaw of Reptiles.</span>&mdash;It is well known that the
lower jaw in mammiferous animals is composed of a single
bone on each side; and that in many genera these pieces
become united in front, and form but one bone in the adult
state. But in reptiles, the lower jaw consists of six distinct
bones on each side, as in <a href="#lign_205"><i>Lign.</i> 205</a>; and these undergo
various modifications of form and arrangement in the different
genera. These bones are distinguished by names which
have reference to their office and situation, and are as follow:&mdash;<a href="#lign_205"><i>Lign.</i> 205</a>,
<i>a</i>, the <i>dentary</i> bone, supporting the teeth; <i>b</i>,
the <i>splenial</i> or <i>opercular</i>; <i>c</i>, the <i>coronoid</i> or <i>complementary</i>;
<i>d</i>, the <i>sur-angular</i>; <i>e</i>, the <i>angular</i>; <i>f</i>, the <i>articular</i>, which
forms the upper portion of the jaw, and includes the condyle.
The form and disposition of these bones in the
Iguana, and other true lizards, are shown in <a href="#lign_205"><i>Lign.</i> 205</a>; but
they differ materially in the Crocodile, Ichthyosaurus, and
other genera. We must restrict our comments to this short
notice, which, however, will suffice to enable the collector
who discovers a fragment of a lower jaw, with any traces of
the structure above described, to determine that it is reptilian;
and if any portion of the <i>dentary</i> bone remains, indications
may be obtained of the family, and perhaps genus,
to which it belonged.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

important modifications in the different orders and families,
that reference to the works already cited must be made for
satisfactory information on this topic. From the great
number of vertebr&aelig; in many reptiles, amounting in the individuals
of some species to nearly two hundred, these bones
are the most abundant fossil relics of these animals to be
found in our collections. The vertebr&aelig; are commonly
detached, and deprived of their processes; the solid <i>centrum</i>,
or body, alone remaining in most examples (as in <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>,
<i>fig.</i> 8). Connected series, more or less complete, are occasionally
discovered; and the entire column, in connexion
with other parts of the skeleton, is preserved in many specimens
in the British and other museums.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> Although, for
the reasons previously stated, minute osteological details
cannot be attempted in this work, some acquaintance with
the elementary characters of the bones composing the spinal
column, and of the nomenclature employed to distinguish
them, is necessary to guide the student, and even the
amateur collector, in their researches. I have, therefore,
selected a few specimens from Tilgate Forest in illustration
of the elements of Saurian vertebr&aelig;, and of the terms by
which the different processes are distinguished; the general

<p>The bones composing the spine, are not only designed to
form a flexible column of support to the trunk, but also to
afford protection to the grand nervous chords constituting
the spinal marrow, and which extend from the brain to the
tail, and give off numerous lateral branches in their course,
conferring sensation and motive power to every part of the
frame. To effect this purpose, there is attached to the
upper or dorsal part of each vertebra a bony ring, called the
neural-arch, which is composed of two processes (<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>,
<i>b</i>.), arising from each side of the body or centrum (<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>,
<i>a</i>.), and which unite above into a solid piece, termed the
spinal process, ox neural spine (<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, <i>d</i>.). On each side
of the annular paid there is a process, called the transverse
(<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, <i>e, e</i>.), for the attachment of muscles; and in the
middle and the posterior dorsal regions of some reptiles, as,
for example, in the existing Crocodiles, these processes articulate
with the ribs. The vertebr&aelig; of the tail have, in addition
to the above, an inferior spinous process, termed the chevron-bone
(<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2, and <i>fig.</i> 3, <i>f</i>.), which gives support to
the inferior layers of the caudal muscles; and, bifurcating at
its attachment to the body of the vertebra, leaves a channel
for the passage of the large blood-vessels, by which the circulation
of the tail is effected.</p>

<p>In the generality of living reptiles (as, for example, in the
Crocodile) the bodies of the vertebr&aelig; are concave in front,
and convex behind; the bones of the spine being united by
ball-and-socket joints; but, in most fossil reptiles, both faces
are either flat, or more or less concave. In mammalian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655"> 655 </a></span>
quadrupeds, the annular part is anchylosed to the vertebral
centre; but in reptiles, it is united by suture, although, in
old subjects, the connecting line is often obliterated. By
reference to <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, and its description, the form, arrangement,
and connexion of the different vertebral elements, in
certain fossil reptiles, may be easily understood. The bones
in the vertebral column of the same animal are considerably
modified in the several regions of the neck (<i>cervical</i> vertebr&aelig;),
back (<i>dorsal</i> and <i>lumbar</i>), and tail (<i>caudal</i>). The cervical
are generally of the most complicated structure; and the
caudal, the most simple.</p>

<p>From this exposition, the reader will perceive that every
vertebra consists of the following essential parts: first, the
body, or <i>centrum</i>; and secondly, the annular part, or <i>neural
arch</i>, so named, because it protects the nervous chord;
while a caudal vertebra has, in addition, the chevron-bone,
called also the <i>h&aelig;mal arch</i>, from its affording a passage to
the large blood-vessels. The bodies of the vertebr&aelig; are in
general solid, and consist of the ordinary osseous structure;
but in certain fossil vertebr&aelig; the centre of the bone is filled
with calcareous spar, indicating an irregular medullary
cavity, as in the caudal vertebr&aelig; of the Ox.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>The <i>Sacrum</i>, which may be termed the key-stone of the
pelvic arch, is formed in existing reptiles by the union of
two vertebr&aelig;; but in the Iguanodon and the Hyl&aelig;osaurus
the sacrum is composed of six anchylosed vertebr&aelig;; in the
Megalosaurus probably of but five.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_585" id="Footnote_585"></a><a href="#FNanchor_585"><span class="label">[585]</span></a> Report, Brit. Assoc. 1841, p. 105, and p. 130.</p></div>

<p>From the sides of the two anchylosed vertebr&aelig; which
form the sacrum, strong, short, rib-like processes are given
off in those Saurians which occasionally walk on dry land,
and these constitute a firm support to the hinder extremities.</p>

<p>In the Crocodiles, the four or five vertebr&aelig; preceding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656"> 656 </a></span>
sacrum have no ribs attached to them, and are termed
<i>lumbar</i>; in the Lizards, there are but two lumbar vertebr&aelig;.
A peculiar modification exists in the first caudal vertebra of
the adult Gavial and Crocodile; the <i>centrum</i> is <i>convex</i> both
in front and behind, as was first demonstrated by me in
1836. See <i>Wond.</i> p. 419, and <i>Petrif.</i> p. 167. The last of
the anchylosed vertebr&aelig; forming the sacrum is concave
posteriorly; hence the necessity of an anterior ball in the
first joint of the tail. (See <a href="#lign_217"><i>Lign.</i> 217</a>, p. 676, illustrative of
<i>Crocodilus Hastingsi&aelig;</i>.) The last <i>cervical</i> vertebra in the
Turtles and Tortoises has a similar construction. This
mechanism confers freedom of motion without risk of dislocation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ribs.</span>&mdash;The Ribs, which are regarded as appendages to the
vertebr&aelig;, (homologues of the pleurapophyses,) are generally
slender and round in the Lizards, and articulate with the
spinal column by a single head, supported on a short convex
process or tubercle. In Crocodiles only of all existing
Reptiles, but in several extinct genera, the proximal end of
the rib forms a double articulation, by a distinct head and
a tubercle, with the vertebr&aelig; in the cervical and anterior
dorsal region of the spinal column; in the posterior dorsal
region the ribs are attached to the elongated transverse
processes of the vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p>As this double articulation of the ribs is invariably associated
in existing reptiles with a heart having double ventricles,
while the lacertian single-headed ribs are in like
manner connected with a heart having but one ventricle,
the student will perceive the important physiological inferences
that spring from the discovery of a mere fragment of
a rib, when interpreted by the profound anatomist.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> In
some fossil reptiles the ribs are flat and very broad; as, for
example, in the Hyl&aelig;osaurus.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_586" id="Footnote_586"></a><a href="#FNanchor_586"><span class="label">[586]</span></a> See Brit. Assoc. Report, 1841, and Memoirs, Pal&aelig;ont. Soc.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_587" id="Footnote_587"></a><a href="#FNanchor_587"><span class="label">[587]</span></a> In Crocodiles the abdominal region is strengthened by slender
ribs (<i>h&aelig;mapophyses</i>, Prof. Owen), that are affixed to a ligamentous
extension of the cartilaginous sternum, analogous to the <i>linea alba</i>
in man; and the Hyl&aelig;osaurus appears to have possessed a similar
development of the costal elements, for I observed many fragments
of long, slender, sub-cylindrical rib-like bones whilst chiselling off
the stone from this species, and portions of similar bones occur
in the stone around the spinal column from Bolney. In the Maidstone
Iguanodon there are likewise some long slender bones of this
character, which I think must be prolongations of the ordinary
dorsal ribs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657"> 657 </a></span></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Extremities.</span>&mdash;The locomotive extremities are variously
constructed, according to the adaptation of the animals to a
terrestrial, fluviatile, or marine existence. The bones of the
limbs in the extinct colossal terrestrial species much resemble
those of our large pachydermata, the Rhinoceros
and Hippopotamus. The cylindrical bones of the extremities
in the Crocodilians, and other recent reptiles, are solid.
<i>i. e.</i> have no cavity filled with marrow; such also is the case
in the fossil Enaliosaurians; but the thigh-bones and leg-bones
of the Iguanodon, and of other extinct land saurians,
h ave a large medullary canal. Our limits will not admit of
further osteological details; and we are compelled to omit
the description of the bones composing the thoracic and
pelvic arches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dermal Bones.</span> <i>Ligns.</i> <a href="#lign_207">207</a> and <a href="#lign_208">208</a>. In many of the
reptile tribes, particularly of the Crocodilian or loricated
(<i>mailed</i>) group, there are immediately under the external
integument or skin a series of osseous scutes, or scutcheons,
variously arranged, which serve as supports to the integumental
scales and spines. In the gigantic Gavial, that inhabits
the Ganges and other rivers of India, and which is
remarkably distinguished from the common Crocodile and
Alligator by an extremely elongated slender muzzle, the
nape of the neck is protected by sixteen or eighteen
transverse rows of dermal scutes; and there are likewise
six rows which extend down the back. These bones are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658"> 658 </a></span>
deeply corrugated or sculptured on their upper surface; a
structure adapted for the firm adhesion of the horny integument.</p>

<p>Detached bones of this character occur in the Purbeck
strata; and the first fragments I collected were supposed by
me to belong to the soft-skinned turtles (<i>Trionyces</i>); but
the subsequent discovery of perfect scutes demonstrated
their analogy to the dermal bones of the Gavial, and enabled
me to determine their true character.</p>

<p>In the splendid specimen of the fossil remains of a Crocodilian
reptile (<i>Goniopholis</i>), found at Swanage (<i>Wond.</i>
pp. 415; and <i>Petrif.</i> p. 170), there are numerous dermal
examples dispersed among the bones, as shown in <i>Petrif.</i> <i>Lign.</i></p>

<p>One of these is figured <a href="#lign_207"><i>Lign.</i> 207</a>; <i>fig.</i> 1 represents
the external surface, which is deeply sculptured by irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659"> 659 </a></span>
roundish pits or excavations; the under or inner surface,
<i>fig.</i> 2, is smooth, but marked with very fine stri&aelig;, decussating
each other at right angles, as in the dermal bones
of the Hyl&aelig;osaurus (<a href="#lign_208"><i>Lign.</i> 208</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1<i>a</i>.). These scutes
differ from those of other recent and fossil Crocodilians,
in a lateral conical projection, marked <i>a</i>, <i>figs.</i> 1, 2, <a href="#lign_207"><i>Lign.</i> 207</a>,
 which fits into a depression on the under surface of
the opposite angle of the adjoining plate; resembling, in
this respect, the scales of the Lepidotus (see <a href="#lign_196"><i>Lign.</i> 196</a>,
p. 605). Numerous hexagonal and pentagonal scutes, articulated
together by marginal sutures, also entered into the
composition of the osseous dermal cuirass of this reptile,
which must, therefore, have possessed a flexible, yet impenetrable,
coat of armour, capable of affording protection
against the attack of any assailant.</p>

<p>In the Oolite, the dermal bones of other slender-nosed
Crocodilians (<i>Teleosaurus</i>) are occasionally met with; the
outer surfaces of which are marked with small circular distinct
pits; these scutes are thicker and more rectangular
than those above described, and slightly overlapped each
other laterally; they have no connecting process. In another
species one half of the outer surface is smooth, proving
that it was covered to that extent by the adjoining scute.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p>

<p>The structure of these bodies is very remarkable; upon
closely inspecting the under side, and the surface exposed
by a transverse fracture, very minute osseous spicula, decussating
each other at right angles, are distinctly seen; as
shown in <a href="#lign_208"><i>Lign.</i> 208</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1<i>a</i>. In <i>fig.</i> 1<i>b</i>, a thin slice of the
same, highly magnified, and viewed by transmitted light,
displays medullary canals, with very fine lines radiating from
them. The peculiar character of this organization consists
in the disposition of the straight bony spicula; an appearance
which first attracted my attention when developing the
original specimen of the Hyl&aelig;osaurus (see <i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 327),
and led to the discovery of some perfect examples, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661"> 661 </a></span>
otherwise would have been destroyed. This structure closely
resembles that presented by the ligamentous fibres of the
<i>corium</i>, or skin, and seems to have resulted from an ossified
condition of the dermal integument. These bones vary from
half an inch to three or four inches in diameter, and were
disposed in one or more longitudinal series on each side the
spine, diminishing in size as they approach the end of
the tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dermal Spines of Hyl&aelig;osaurus.</span> <a href="#lign_208"><i>Lign.</i> 208</a>, <i>fig.</i> 4.&mdash;With
the dermal bones above described there are associated
in the first discovered specimen of the Hyl&aelig;osaurus, flat,
thin, angular, osseous plates, from three to seventeen inches
in length; one of which is figured <a href="#lign_208"><i>Lign.</i> 208</a>, <i>fig.</i> 4. The
manner in which they are imbedded in the rocks, in connexion
with other parts of the skeleton, is shown Wond.
pl. iv. and <i>Geol. S. E.</i> pl. v. These very remarkable processes
appeared to me to have formed part of a serrated
fringe, which extended along the back of the reptile, analogous
to that observable in certain living lizards (<i>Wond.</i>
p. 436, <a href="#lign_108"><i>Lign.</i> 108</a>); and were provisionally described as
such in my first memoir on the Hyl&aelig;osaurus. This conjecture
has been substantiated by subsequent discoveries, and
the true nature of the large, flat, angular spines, and the
conical bones resembling the horn-cones of ruminants,
which occur in the Wealden, is now established.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Horn of Iguanodon.</span>&mdash;In this category may be placed
the nasal tubercle or horn of a saurian, like that of the
Iguana (<a href="#lign_208"><i>Lign.</i> 208</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2; <i>Geol. S. E.</i> pl. iii.), found with
the remains of the Iguanodon, and probably belonging to
that colossal reptile (<i>Wond.</i> p. 431; and <i>Petrif.</i> p. 298).
It is four inches in length and 3.2 inch by 2.1 inch in
diameter at the base, which is of an irregular elliptical
form. Several smaller specimens have recently been discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662"> 662 </a></span></p>

<p>Examples of dermal scutes and spines, presenting modifications
of form and structure distinct from those above
described, have been brought to me from various localities
of the Wealden; but, as in no instance a connexion with
other parts of the skeleton could be traced, the particular
reptiles to which they belonged cannot be ascertained.</p>

<p>The living <span class="smcap">Ichthyosaurus</span> must have borne a resemblance
to a Grampus or Porpoise, with four large flippers or
paddles and a long tail, having a vertical caudal fin of
moderate dimensions; the skin probably being naked and
smooth, as in the Cetaceans. The <span class="smcap">Plesiosaurus</span> presented a
configuration still more extraordinary (<i>Wond.</i> p. 575). With
a very small head, it possessed a neck of enormous length, a
body of moderate size, with four paddles, resembling those of
turtles, and a very short tail. They were both marine, air-breathing,
cold-blooded, carnivorous, vertebrate animals;
swarming in prodigious numbers during the secondary
epochs, and particularly in the seas of the Liassic period
(<i>Ly.</i> p. 277, figs. 310, 311). In both genera the construction
of the skeleton presents many important variations

<p>In the Ichthyosaurus, the nasal apertures or openings of
the nostrils are not towards the snout, as in the Crocodile,
but near the anterior angle of the orbit (see <a href="#lign_209"><i>Lign.</i> 209</a>),
approaching, in this respect, some of the recent lizards. The
orbit is very large, and the sclerotic coat or capsule of the
eye has in front an annular series of bony plates (<i>Bd.</i> pl. x.
<i>figs.</i> 1, 3), which often occur in their natural position
(<a href="#lign_209"><i>Lign.</i> 209</a>). This structure is not possessed by fishes, but
is analogous to that observable in the eyes of turtles, lizards,
and many birds; as for example, in the owl and eagle: it
confers on the eye additional power of adaptation and intensity
of vision. The muzzle of the Ichthyosaurus is long
and pointed; the lower jaw is formed of two branches,
united anteriorly through nearly half their length; each
branch is composed of six bones, as in the Crocodile and
Lizards, but differently arranged than in those reptiles.
The teeth are very numerous, amounting to nearly two
hundred in some species, and are placed in a single row
along the jaws, being implanted in a deep continuous
groove (see <i>Bd.</i> pl. xi.). These teeth are of a pointed
conical form, longitudinally striated, with an expanded base
(<a href="#lign_210"><i>Lign.</i> 210</a>). The new teeth are developed at the inner
side of the base of the old, and grow up and displace them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665"> 665 </a></span>
(see <a href="#lign_210"><i>Lign.</i> 210</a>). The microscopical structure of the teeth
of the Ichthyosaurus is beautifully illustrated by Professor
Owen (<i>Odontography</i>, p. 275, pl. lxiv.). The tooth consists
of a pulp-cavity, surrounded by a body of dentine,
which is invested at the base by a thick layer of cement;
and at the crown by a coat of enamel, also covered by a
pellicle of cement 3 the pulp-cavity, in fully-formed teeth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666"> 666 </a></span>
is more or less occupied by coarse bone. The chief peculiarity
of this structure consists in the inflection of the
cement into vertical folds at the base of the tooth, by
which the marginal portion of the basal dentine is divided
into a corresponding number of processes; producing, in a
transverse section, the appearance represented in <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI.
fig. 9</i></a>. This organization, as we have previously remarked,
is similar to that observable in the teeth of the <i>Lepidosteus</i>
(see <a href="#Page_616">p. 616</a>), and of the extinct reptile, called <i>Labyrinthodon</i>,
hereafter to be noticed.</p>

<p>The vertebr&aelig;; (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xii.; and <a href="#lign_211"><i>Lign.</i> 211</a>), of which
there are upwards of one
hundred and forty in the
individuals of some species,
are relatively very short in
their antero-posterior diameter
(<i>i. e.</i> from front to
back); and deeply cupped
on each articulating face, as
in fishes. The annular part
is not united to the body of
the vertebra, as in mammals,
nor connected by suture, as
in Crocodiles, but terminates
on each side in a compressed oval base, which fits
into corresponding sockets
placed on the boundary line
of the spinal depression on the body (<a href="#lign_210"><i>Lign.</i> 210</a>, 2<i>a</i>); thus
completing the medullary canal (see <i>Bd.</i> pl. xii. <i>fig.</i> D, E.).
Hence the collector may easily recognise the body of an
Ichthyosaurian vertebra, by the pits or depressions on the
sides of the spinal interspace. The first and second vertebra;
are anchylosed together, and have additional subvertebral,
wedge-shaped bones, which render this part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667"> 667 </a></span>
the column a fixed point of support.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xii. figs.
3, 6.) The form and arrangement of the bones that enter
into the composition of the pectoral and pelvic arches, and
of the paddles, are exemplified in <i>Bd.</i> pl. xii.; and full
osteological details are given
in <i>Brit. Assoc. Rep.</i> 1839,
p. 104. The characters of
the several bones composing
the pectoral arch of
the Ichthyosaur will be
readily understood from the
accompanying illustration.
The structure of the pectoral
arch of the Plesiosaur
is also shown in an accompanying Lignograph, for the
sake of comparison. The
bones of a fore-paddle of
an Ichthyosaurus are represented
(<a href="#lign_214"><i>Lign.</i> 214</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1).
In some species each paddle
consists of nearly one hundred
bones. These locomotive
extremities are very
analogous in their osteological
construction to those
of the Cetaceans, but they
are connected with the trunk
by means of the glenoid
socket formed by the scapula and coracoid, which are firmly
united to the sternum; whereas in the Cetaceans the
pectoral fin is only attached to a simple scapula, which is
merely suspended in the muscles. This structure, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668"> 668 </a></span>
with the presence of a clavicle in the Ichthyosaurus (see
<a href="#lign_212"><i>Lign.</i> 212</a>), which is wanting in the Cetaceans,, indicates, in
the opinion of Professor Owen, that this marine fish-lizard
was capable of some degree of locomotion on the land; and
that it might have resorted to the shore to deposit its eggs,
or, like the Crocodile, to sleep. From the frequent occurrence
of a dislocation or abrupt bend of the vertebral series
of the tail, at about one-third of its length from the end, supposed
to have been produced by the weight of a large fin,
during the progress of decomposition, and from the terminal
caudal vertebr&aelig; being laterally compressed, it is inferred that
the Ichthyosaurus had a vertical fin at the extremity of the
tail, which would thus be rendered a powerful instrument of
progressive motion.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> From the appearance of the <i>Coprolites</i>,
which occur abundantly with the skeletons of these animals,
it is obvious that the intestinal canal in the Ichthyosaurus
was furnished with spiral valves, as in the Sharks; and the
comminuted bones and scales in the coprolites prove that
fishes constituted the principal food of these marine reptiles.</p>

<p>The Ichthyosaurus has abdominal ribs (<a href="#Page_656">p. 656</a>, note), as
in the Crocodile, and it is therefore inferred that, if oviparous,
it did not produce ova in such immense numbers as
the Batrachians, &amp;c. A specimen found by the late Mr.
Channing Pearce renders it probable that the Ichthyosaurus
may have been viviparous. A remarkably perfect adult
Ichthyosaurus, examined by this gentleman, contained the
bones of a f&#339;tus (a few inches long) <i>in the cavity of the
pelvis</i>. This specimen is in the collection of Mr. Pearce,
at Bath. Remains or traces of the dermal integument have
been discovered in some examples from the Lias of Barrow-on-Soar,
Lyme Regis, Ilminster, and the neighbourhood of
Tewkesbury.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670"> 670 </a></span>
are imbedded, and which has so often been insisted upon in the
preceding pages, is strikingly exemplified in the highly interesting
example of the hinder paddle of an Ichthyosaurus
(<i>I. communis</i>) discovered by Sir Philip Egerton. <a href="#lign_215"><i>Lign.</i> 215</a>
is reduced from the exquisite representation of the specimen
accompanying the original memoir by Prof. Owen on this
fossil, in the Geological Transactions. The specimen consists
of the phalangeal bones of a posterior paddle, with the
impression of the soft parts or integuments in their natural
position; <i>a</i>, marks the termination or distal extremity
of the fin, consisting entirely of the softer integuments;
these gradually widen and expand to receive the terminal
rows of the phalangeal ossicles or bones, marked <i>b</i>. The
upper border of this integumentary part of the paddle (<i>c</i>) is
formed by a smooth, well-defined line, apparently a mere
duplicature of integument. But the lower margin (<i>d</i>) exhibits
the impressions of a series of rays, by which the fold of
integument was supported; these rays bifurcate as they
approach the margin of the fin, and were probably either
cartilaginous, or composed of an albuminous horny tissue,
like the marginal rays in the fins of Sharks. Dr. Buckland
detected remains of the dermal integument of an Ichthyosaurus
in a specimen from the Lias at Barrow-on-Soar
(<i>Bd.</i> ii. p. 22, pl. x.); and in a fine skeleton with the four
paddles (now in the British Museum), which I obtained
from that locality, there were decided traces of the carbonized
integuments around each paddle, but which were,
unfortunately, chiselled away, in developing the bones,
before I was aware of their true nature.</p>

<p>In Mr. Coles&#8217;s paper, already referred to, the student has
an instructive instance of the value of a careful examination
of faint or obscure traces of organic matter accompanying
these saurian remains, and how such an examination should
be made. The Plate illustrative of the Memoir exhibits
the minute, hooked, conical bodies, that form the dense felt-like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671"> 671 </a></span>
mass which the black film, frequently accompanying
these fossil bones, appears to consist of, when seen under
the microscope. To what extent this substance entered
into the constitution of the integuments, or of the exact
relation of these "setiform scales" to the surface or the
interior of the skin, our present knowledge does not enable
us to judge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PLESIOSAURUS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Plesiosaurus.</span> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xvi.&mdash;xix.)&mdash;The animals of this
genus present in their osteological structure a remarkable
deviation from all known recent and fossil reptiles; uniting
the characters of the head of a lizard, with the teeth of a
crocodile, to a neck of inordinate length, with such modifications
of the ribs, the pectoral and pelvic arches, and the
paddles, as to justify the graphic simile of Professor Sedgwick,
that the Plesiosaurus might be compared to a serpent
threaded through the shell of a turtle.</p>

<p>The character which immediately strikes the observer, is
the extraordinary length of the neck, and the relative smallness
of the head. The neck, which in most animals is
formed of but five vertebr&aelig;, and in the extremest recent
example, the Swan, does not exceed twenty-four, is in the
Plesiosaurus composed of from twenty to forty; and, in
some species, is four times the length of the head, and
equal to the entire length of the body and tail; while the
length of the head (in <i>P. dolichodeirus</i>) is less than one-thirteenth
of the entire skeleton. The skull resembles that
of the crocodile in its general form, but is relatively smaller,
and is more related to the lacertian type. The parietal
bone is more triquetal than in the crocodiles; but the
zygomatic bone is attached to its lower end. The breathing
apertures are situated anterior to the orbits, on the highest
part of the head. The lower jaw has the usual structure of
the Saurians; but the dentary bone is greatly expanded
anteriorly, and united in front (see <i>Bd.</i> pl. xix.). The
teeth are implanted in separate sockets, as in the crocodile,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672"> 672 </a></span>
and there are from thirty to forty on each side the jaws.
They are conical, slender, long, pointed, slightly recurved,
and longitudinally grooved from the base upwards; having
a long round fang. The pulp-cavity is long and single,
surrounded by a body of firm dentine, covered on the crown
with a layer of enamel, and at the base with cement (<i>Odont.</i>
pl. lxxiv.). The dentition in the Plesiosauri differs from
that of the Crocodiles, in the successional teeth emerging
through distinct apertures on the inner side of the sockets
of their predecessors, and not through the pulp-cavity.
The vertebr&aelig; are relatively longer than in the Ichthyosaurus,
and their articular faces are either flat, or slightly
excavated towards the periphery, with a gentle convexity
in the centre (<i>Foss. Til. For.</i> pl. ix. fig. 4).<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_595" id="Footnote_595"></a><a href="#FNanchor_595"><span class="label">[595]</span></a> For details, see Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1839, p. 50.</p></div>

<p>The caudal vertebr&aelig; have two distinct h&aelig;mapophyses,
not united into a chevron-bone.</p>

<p>The cervical ribs, or hatchet-bones, are attached by two
articular facets to the bodies of the vertebr&aelig;, but with a
very narrow space between; scarcely large enough even for
the passage of the sympathetic nerve; and apparently not
sufficient for the vertebral artery.</p>

<p>The <i>pectoral arch</i> is remarkable for the pair of elongated
and broad coracoid bones (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xvii. and <a href="#lign_213"><i>Lign.</i> 213</a>);
indeed the coracoids attain their maximum of development
in the Plesiosaurus. The <i>ribs</i>, which are very numerous,
and extend throughout a great portion of the vertebral
column, are connected, anteriorly, in the abdominal region,
by several slender bones, called <i>costal-arcs</i>, consisting of six
or seven pieces to each pair of ribs; the Ichthyosaurus has
a similar structure, but the arcs are composed of but five
pieces. As these connecting bones are so constructed as to
admit of a certain degree of gliding motion upon each other,
it is inferred that, by this mechanism, considerable expansion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673"> 673 </a></span>
of the pulmonary cavities in these air-breathing marine
reptiles was obtained (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xviii. fig. 3).</p>

<p>The paddles are composed of fewer and more slender
bones than in the Ichthyosaurus, and must have been of a
more elegant form, and possessed greater flexibility (<a href="#lign_214"><i>Lign.</i> 214</a>,
 <i>fig.</i> 2). The wrist (<i>carpus</i>) consists of a double row
of round ossicles, which are succeeded by five elongated
metacarpal, and these by numerous, slender and slightly-curved
phalangeal bones.</p>

<p>Sixteen species of Plesiosaurus and ten of Ichthyosaurus
have been discovered in the British strata, and nearly forty
are now known; their geological range is from the Lias
to the Chalk, inclusive.<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Their remains are found most
abundantly in the Lias and Oolite. I have collected many
Plesiosaurian vertebr&aelig; in the Wealden, and in the Green
Sand of Farringdon. No traces of Ichthyosauri have been
observed in the Wealden; but vertebr&aelig;, and jaws with
teeth, occur in the lower Chalk and Galt of Kent and
Cambridgeshire.<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> On the Continent the remains of Enaliosaurians

portions of the vertebral column, and many bones
of the extremities have been discovered in the Kimmeridge
clay of Oxfordshire, and are preserved in Dr. Buckland&#8217;s
museum. The teeth resemble those of the Plesiosaurus in
their general aspect, being of a conical form, longitudinally
grooved, and having a long fang; but they are readily distinguished
by the subtrihedral form of the crown, produced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674"> 674 </a></span>
by the smooth, flat, or slightly convex external surface;
they approach in this respect the tooth of the Mosasaurus;

<p>The British fossil species, most nearly related to the

<p>In the strata of Tilgate Forest, associated with innumerable
remains of reptiles of various kinds, teeth of the
Crocodilian type, belonging to two genera, are not uncommon.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
The first kind (<i>Suchosaurus</i><a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> <i>cultridens</i> of
Prof. Owen) is a tooth about an inch in length, of a slender
acuminated form, compressed laterally, and gently recurved,
with a sharp edge in front and behind; resembling, in its
general figure, the tooth of a Megalosaurus, with the serrations
on the edges worn off (<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 7</i></a>). The sides of
the crown are marked with a few longitudinal grooves.
Some biconcave vertebr&aelig; found in the same quarries, and
characterized by the compressed wedge-shaped form of the
centre (<i>Foss. Til. For.</i> pl. ix. <i>fig.</i> 11), are supposed by Professor
Owen to belong to the same reptile as the teeth above
described; but it is hazardous to pronounce on the identity
of these detached teeth and bones, without more corroborative
proof than has hitherto been obtained.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swanage Crocodile.</span> (<i>Goniopholis crassidens.</i>) <i>Petrif.</i>
p. 170, <i>Lign.</i> 38.&mdash;Under this name, the second species of
Crocodilian teeth will be considered; the discovery of
a considerable portion of a skeleton of a reptile with teeth
of this form (<i>Wond.</i> p. 416), in a quarry near Swanage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678"> 678 </a></span>
having disclosed some of the most important osteological
characters of the original. These teeth are distinguished
from the former by their cylindrical base, and rounded,
obtuse, conical crowns (<i>Petrif.</i> p. 171): they somewhat
resemble in form those of the Crocodile, but the crown is
strongly marked with numerous, well-defined, longitudinal
grooves and ridges; and there is a sharp ridge on the middle
of each side. A small specimen, broken off at the base, is
represented <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 5</i></a>; it shows the smooth cylindrical
base of the tooth, which is covered with cement, and the
finely striated enamelled crown; some of the teeth are more
than two inches in length, and one inch in diameter at the
base (<i>Foss. Til For.</i> pl. v. figs. 1, 2). I have found these
teeth in numerous localities; they are always well preserved,
with the ridges sharp, and have a high polish (<i>Geol. I. Wight</i>,
p. 357, <i>Lign.</i> 30); a series of successional teeth may often
be detected in the pulp-cavity (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 414). The
detached teeth, and fragments of dermal bones (<a href="#lign_207"><i>Lign.</i> 207</a>),
which, from their constant occurrence with this species,
I had been led to consider as belonging to the same reptile,
were the only relics that had come under my observation,
until the discovery of the Swanage specimen above mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a>
On the two corresponding slabs containing this fine
fossil are imbedded many detached teeth; a portion of the
left side of the lower jaw, with two teeth in place; ribs and
numerous vertebr&aelig;, which are biconcave, and have an irregular
medullary cavity in the centre of the body; chevron
bones resembling those of the Crocodile; the bones of the
pelvic arch, and some of those of the extremities. With
these are the remains of the osseous dermal cuirass, consisting
of numerous scutes (figured and described p. 657,
<a href="#lign_207"><i>Lign.</i> 207</a>), scattered at random among the other relics of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679"> 679 </a></span>
skeleton; some having the inner, and others the external
surface exposed; several of these bones are perfect, and
exceed six inches in length, and two and a half in breadth.
Numerous scales of a small Ganoid fish (<i>Lepidotus minor</i>),
common in the Purbeck strata, are also intermingled with
these remains. This reptile is named <i>Goniopholis crassidens</i>,
by Professor Owen.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">P&#339;cilopleuron.</span>&mdash;The remains of an allied genus of Crocodile,
the <i>P&#339;cilopleuron Bucklandi</i> (of Deslongchamps),
occur in the Oolite, near Caen, Normandy. This reptile,
like the Goniopholis, had biconcave vertebr&aelig;, with a large
medullary cavity in the middle of the centrum. The body
of the vertebr&aelig; is contracted in the middle, the neural arch
anchylosed, with no trace of suture, and with a thin spinous
process, which is remarkable for its backward inclination.
Vertebr&aelig; of this character also occur in the Wealden strata
of Tilgate Forest and the Isle of Wight.<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teleosaurus.</span> (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxv.)&mdash;In the Oolite of England
and the Continent, the remains of a genus of extinct reptiles,
having, like the recent Gavial, long slender muzzles, have
been discovered in several localities. These fossils consist
of the osseous scutes of an imbricated dermal cuirass; of
the cranium and jaws with teeth; of the vertebral column;
and many other bones. The characters of the dermal
scutes, and of the muzzle with its terminal nasal apertures,
have already been described (<a href="#Page_659">p. 659</a>, and <a href="#Page_676">p. 676</a>). There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680"> 680 </a></span>
several species of <i>Teleosaurus</i>; a splendid specimen of
<i>T. Chapmanni</i>, fifteen feet long, from the Lias-shale on the
Yorkshire coast, is preserved in the Whitby Museum; and
there are interesting examples in the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
Teleosaurian remains have been found in the Oolite at
Stonesfield, and at Deddington, Oxfordshire; and Mr. C.
Moore, of Ilminster, whose museum is rich with perfect
Ichthyosaurs and Fishes from the Upper Lias of the neighbourhood,
has been highly successful in developing some
charming specimens of small Teleosaurs from out of the
same deposit. In the Oolite of Caen, in Normandy, very
fine specimens of <i>T. Cadomensis</i> have been discovered; and
from these the illustrious Cuvier first determined the character
and affinities of the original.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a> The British Oolite
contains also the relics of a reptile with biconcave vertebr&aelig;,
belonging to the genus <i>Steneosaurus</i>: the cranium with the
jaws and teeth have been found in Kimmeridge clay, at
Shotover (<i>Bd.</i> pl. xxv.).<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a></p>

<p>From the Jura limestone at Monheim, in Franconia, the
remains of a small Crocodilian reptile (Teleosaurus priscus),
with a long slender muzzle, have been obtained. In a specimen<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
from the former locality, the skull, jaws with teeth,
the entire vertebral column, and many parts of the skeleton

<p><span class="smcap">Streptospondylus</span>, <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, <i>figs.</i> 5, 7.&mdash;Baron Cuvier
in his celebrated work, "<i>Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles</i>,"
has given an elaborate description of the remains of two
kinds of slender-nosed Crocodilians, from the Kimmeridge
clay of Honfleur, and the Oxford clay of Havre.</p>

<p>The specimens consist of the jaws with teeth, vertebr&aelig;,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681"> 681 </a></span>
and some bones of the extremities.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> In one species, the
vertebr&aelig; are biconcave; in the other, they are convexo-concave,
and present a remarkable deviation from the
recent Crocodilian type, namely, that they are placed in a
reversed position,&mdash;the convex face of the vertebra being
directed anteriorly, or towards the cranium, and the concavity
posteriorly; the name of the genus, <i>Streptospondylus</i>
(reversed-spine), denotes this peculiarity of structure. The
bodies of three or four large convexo-concave cervical
vertebr&aelig;, were discovered in the Tilgate strata many years
since, and are described in my various works (<i>Geol. S. E.</i>
p. 300); but no suspicion was then entertained of their
belonging to this genus, although I had repeatedly compared
them with the figures of the Honfleur crocodile,<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> the imperfect
state of the processes obscuring their true characters.
Professor Owen first detected the true character of these
Wealden vertebr&aelig;, in a large cervical, six inches long (now
in the British Museum), in which two oblique processes are
preserved on the concave end of the bone, their flat, oblong,
articular faces, are directed downwards and outwards,&mdash;a
character which at once proves them to be the posterior
pair, for the anterior oblique processes would be directed
upwards and inwards.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Vertebr&aelig; of the same species occur
in the Wealden of the Isle of Wight; and of another species
in the Oolite at Chipping Norton, and in the Lias of
Whitby.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_618" id="Footnote_618"></a><a href="#FNanchor_618"><span class="label">[618]</span></a> Brit. Assoc. Rep. 1841, p. 92. The position of the articulating
surfaces of the oblique processes (<i>zygapophyses</i>) in more perfect specimens,
subsequently discovered in various localities of the Wealden,
established the existence not only of a saurian allied to the Streptospondylus,
but also of other reptiles whose spinal column was wholly
or in part made up of vertebr&aelig; which were convex in front and concave
behind, as in the cervicals and anterior dorsals of certain mammalia.
Some of these fossil vertebr&aelig; Dr. Melville has referred, with
great probability, to the cervical region of the Iguanodon (see <i>Petrif.</i>
p. 259); others cannot at present be satisfactorily assigned to any
known genus of reptiles.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682"> 682 </a></span></p>

<p>A concavo-convex caudal vertebra, with the relations of
which I am unacquainted, was found in the same quarry in
Tilgate Forest; a reduced outline of this unique fossil is
given in <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, <i>fig.</i> 1. The centrum is of a sub-cylindrical
form, and the articular face in front is concave, and
that behind, convex; with a chevron-bone that is anchylosed
to the body of the vertebra, as in some of the caudals of the
Mosasaurus, and terminates in an inferior spine (<i>f.</i>); the pair
of anterior oblique processes remains; the neural spinous
process is destroyed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cetiosaurus.</span>&mdash;From a considerable number of verteb&aelig;
and bones of the extremities of some gigantic aquatic reptiles,
discovered in the Oolite in various places in Oxfordshire,
Northamptonshire, and Yorkshire, the present genus
was established; the name being intended to indicate a distant
general resemblance of these extinct Saurians to the
Cetaceans.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> The vertebra; differ from those of the Iguanodon
in having their articular faces of a sub-circular form,
and the body relatively short; the anterior face is nearly
flat, and the posterior concave, in the dorsal vertebra;; but
in the caudal both faces are concave, and have a well-defined
elevated margin, which gives the body a deeply excavated
character, easily recognizable. Vertebr&aelig; of this kind were
among my earliest discoveries in the strata of Tilgate Forest.
(<i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 282.) Some specimens are eight inches in
the transverse diameter of the articular face, and but four
and a half inches in the antero-posterior length of the body.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
The original animals are supposed to have been of aquatic,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683"> 683 </a></span>
and probably of marine habits, on the evidence of the sub-biconcave
structure of the vertebr&aelig; and of the coarse cancellous
tissue of the long bones, which are destitute of a
medullary cavity. They must have rivalled the modern
whales in bulk, for some specimens indicate a length of forty
or fifty feet; they are supposed to have had web-feet, and a
broad vertical tail.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a></p>

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL REPTILES; COMPRISING THE DEINOSAURIANS, PTERODACTYLES,
TURTLES, SERPENTS, AND BATRACHIANS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><a id="III_Deinosaurians"></a>III. Deinosaurians.</span>&mdash;The Order <span class="smcap">Deinosauria</span> (<i>fearfully-great
lizards</i>) has been established for the reception of those
extinct colossal reptiles, comprising the <i>Megalosaurus</i>, <i>Hyl&aelig;osaurus</i>,
<i>Iguanodon</i>, and <i>Pelorosaurus</i>, which, in their organization,
present the transition from the Crocodilians to the
Lacertians, and whose essential osteological characters Professor
Owen has described as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p class="smaller">"This group, which includes at least three well-established genera
of Saurians, is characterized by a large sacrum, composed of five
anchylosed vertebr&aelig; of unusual construction; by the height, breadth,
and outward sculpture of the neural arch of the dorsal vertebr&aelig;; by
the two-fold articulation of the ribs to the vertebra:, viz. at the anterior
part of the spine by a head and tubercle, and along the rest of
the trunk by a tubercle attached to the transverse process only; by
broad, and sometimes complicated, coracoids, and long and slender
clavicles; whereby Crocodilian characters of the vertebral column
are combined with a Lacertian type of the pectoral arch. The dental
organs also exhibit the same transitional or annectent characters, in
a greater or lesser degree. The bones of the extremities are of large
proportional size for Saurians; they are provided with large medullary
cavities, and with well developed and unusual processes, and are
terminated by metacarpal, metatarsal, and phalangeal bones, which,
with the exception of the ungual phalanges, more or less resemble
those of the heavy pachydermal Mammals, and attest, with the
hollow long-bones, the terrestrial habits of the species.</p>

<p class="smaller">"The combinations of such characters, some, as the sacral ones,
altogether peculiar among Reptiles, others borrowed, as it were,
from groups now distinct from each other, and all manifested by
creatures far surpassing in size the largest of existing reptiles, will, it
is presumed, be deemed sufficient ground for establishing a distinct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685"> 685 </a></span>
tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles, for which I would propose the
name of Dinosauria.</p>

<p class="smaller">"Of this tribe the principal and best established genera are the
<i>Megalosaurus</i>, the <i>Hyl&aelig;osaurus</i>, and the <i>Iguanodon</i>; the gigantic
Crocodile-lizards of the dry land; the peculiarities of the osteological
structure of which distinguish them as clearly from the modern terrestrial
and amphibious Sauria, as the opposite modifications for an
aquatic life characterize the extinct <i>Enaliosauria</i>, or Marine Lizards."<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<p>The elaborate investigation of the fossil remains of these
stupendous beings, and the luminous exposition of their
organization and physiological relations, embodied in the
report to which the above extract is introductory, are among
the most important contributions to Pal&aelig;ontology, and
afford a striking example of the successful application of
profound anatomical knowledge to the elucidation of the
most marvellous epoch in the earth&#8217;s physical history, the
<i>Age of Reptiles</i>.</p>

<p>From the great size of the bones of these reptiles, their
remains have excited the curiosity even of the common
observer; and although an exaggerated idea has been generally
entertained of the magnitude of the original animals,
yet, even when reduced to their natural proportions by the
rigorous formula of the anatomist, applied to the accumulated
relics which years of laborious research have exhumed
from their rocky sepulchres and deposited in our museums,
their dimensions are sufficiently stupendous to satisfy the
most enthusiastic lover of the marvellous.</p>

<p>Let the reader visit the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> and after
examining the largest thigh-bone of the Iguanodon, repair to
the zoological gallery, and inspect the recent Crocodilian
reptiles, some twenty-five or thirty feet in length; and
observe that the fossil <i>bone</i> equals, if not surpasses, in size,
the entire <i>thigh</i> of the largest of existing reptiles; then let
him imagine this bone clothed with proportionate muscles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686"> 686 </a></span>
and integuments, and reflect upon the enormous trunk
which such limbs must have been destined to move and to
sustain&mdash;and he will obtain a just notion of the appalling
magnitude of the lizards which inhabited the country of the
Iguanodon.</p>

and 219. <i>Bd.</i> pl. xxiii. <i>Wond.</i> p 421.&mdash;The oolitic flag-stone
of Stonesfield, in Oxfordshire, has long been celebrated
for the bones and teeth of a gigantic reptile, which Dr. Buckland
first described by the name of <i>Megalosaurus</i>, in a highly
interesting memoir (<i>Trans. Geol. Soc.</i> <i>sec. ser.</i> vol. i.), illustrated
by figures of the teeth in a portion of the lower jaw,
the sacrum, femur, and other bones. The remains of this
reptile are also frequently discovered in the Wealden (see <i>Foss.
Til. For.</i> p. 67, pl. ix. figs. 2, 6). The most important relic of
this great carnivorous terrestrial lizard is a portion of the
right ramus of the lower jaw, containing one perfect tooth,
and the germs of several teeth (<a href="#lign_218"><i>Lign.</i> 218</a>). The tooth of the
Megalosaurus, (<a href="#lign_219"><i>Lign.</i> 219</a>, and <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 7</i></a>,) has a conical,
laterally compressed crown, with the
point recurved like a sabre, and the
edges trenchant and finely serrated. The
implantation of the teeth is very peculiar,
and exhibits the dentition of the
Crocodilians blended with that of the
Lacertians. The jaw has an outer parapet,
as in the true lizards (see <a href="#lign_205"><i>Lign.</i> 205</a>),
but the teeth are fixed in distinct
sockets, formed by transverse partitions,
that are attached to a mesial (<i>inner</i>)
parapet, composed of a series of triangular
osseous plates; the bases of the
old teeth, and the germs of the new
ones, being thus enclosed and concealed.
The tooth is formed of a central body of
dentine, the crown having a coating
enamel; and the whole an external investment
of cement, which forms a thicker layer around the
fang; the pulp-cavity is occupied by coarse bone, in the
adult tooth. The microscopical examination shows the
dentine to consist of very fine calcigerous tubes, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>28000</sub>th of
an inch in diameter, without any admixture of medullary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688"> 688 </a></span>
canals, radiating from the pulp-cavity at right angles with
the external surface of the tooth, and sending; off numerous
secondary branches; these ultimately dilate into, or inosculate
with, a stratum of calcigerous cells that separates the
dentine from the enamel.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> A thin slice of a vertical section,

<p>Four specimens of the sacrum, composed of five anchylosed
vertebral (<i>Foss. Til. For.</i> pl. xix. <i>fig.</i> 12), have been
discovered; one of these is from Tilgate Forest. The femur
of the Megalosaurus has two large rounded trochanters of
nearly equal size, below the head of the bone; its shaft is
sub-cylindrical, and slightly bowed.</p>

<p>This colossal carnivorous Saurian, whose length is estimated
at thirty feet, appears to have been terrestrial, and
an inhabitant of the same <i>terra incognita</i> as the Iguanodon;
it probably preyed on the smaller reptiles, and the young of
the Iguanodon, Crocodilians, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hyl&aelig;osaurus</span> (<i>Wealden lizard</i>) <span class="smcap">Owenii</span>. <i>Wond.</i> pl. iv.
and p. 435; <i>Geol. S. E.</i> pl. v.&mdash;In the summer of 1832,
I obtained the interesting specimen which first demonstrated
the existence of the remains of another extraordinary modification
of Saurian organization in the Wealden. The
circumstances which led to this discovery afford an instructive
lesson to the young collector.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689"> 689 </a></span></p>

<p class="smaller">Upon visiting a quarry in Tilgate Forest, which had yielded many
organic remains, I perceived in some fragments of a large mass of
stone, which had recently been broken up and thrown on the road-side,
traces of numerous pieces of bone. I therefore collected all the
recognisable portions of the block, and had them conveyed to my
residence. The first step was to cement together those pieces that
would admit of juxtaposition, and these were at length united into a
block of stone five feet long, three wide, and about one foot thick.
This was firmly fixed in a stout frame, to prevent the separation of
the united portions during the process of chiselling. Guided by the
indications which the sections visible on the edge afforded, a thin
iron wedge was carefully driven in, about half an inch above the
uppermost layer of bones, and a large slab was flaked off; the three
dermal spines (<i>Wond.</i> pl. iv. 5) in the middle of the specimen were
thus exposed, and shivered to pieces; some fragments adhered to the
mass broken off, others to the block, and many were detached; every
piece, however small, was collected, and those adhering to the slab
were chiselled out; and the whole were then carefully replaced and
cemented to the bones that remained imbedded in the large block.
After an interval of some days, to allow of the firm cohesion of the
cemented parts, the task was resumed, and the stone chiselled away,
until some portion of the large bones of the pectoral arch (<i>Wond.</i> pl.
iv. 7) were observed. The specimen was at length brought to the
state in which it now appears (in the British Museum<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>); but during
the progress of its development, which occupied many weeks, it was
repeatedly necessary to suspend the work, and unite displaced fragments
of bone, and resume the task after their consolidation. The
plate in the <i>Geol. S. E.</i> conveys a good idea of the original.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_632" id="Footnote_632"></a><a href="#FNanchor_632"><span class="label">[632]</span></a> See <i>Fossils, Brit. Mus.</i> p. 139, &amp;c.</p></div>

<p>The specimen consists of a part of the spinal column,
composed of seven dorsal and three or four cervical vertebr&aelig;,
almost in their natural juxtaposition, with obscure
indications of a part of the base of the skull; eleven ribs;
the bones of the pectoral arch (two <i>coracoids</i> and two <i>scapul&aelig;</i>);
with numerous dermal bones and spines. A second
specimen of this reptile was found near Bolney, in Sussex;
and like the former, it was, unfortunately, almost wholly
destroyed by the labourers; but I obtained many bones,
some of which are perfect, and indicate an animal of considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690"> 690 </a></span>
magnitude: a <i>scapula</i>, nineteen inches long, an arm-bone
or <i>humerus</i>, numerous ribs, bones of the phalanges, &amp;c.
A fine series of twenty-six caudal vertebra, having a total
length of nearly six feet, with chevron bones and dermal
spines, was discovered in 1837, in Tilgate Forest.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> A few
detached bones are the only other relics of this reptile that
have come under my observation.<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> The osteological characters
presented by these remains afford another example
of tire blending of the Crocodilian with the Lacertian type
of structure; for we have in the pectoral arch the scapula
or omoplate of a crocodile associated with the coracoid of
a lizard. Another remarkable feature in these fossils is the
presence of the large angular bones or spines (described
p. 660, figured <a href="#lign_208"><i>Lign.</i> 208</a>), which, there is reason to infer,
constituted a serrated crest along the middle of the back:
and the numerous small oval dermal bones, which appear to
have been arranged in longitudinal series along each side of
the dorsal fringe. (<i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 323.)</p>

<p>The vertebr&aelig;, ribs, and other parts of the skeleton found
in these specimens also present modifications of structure
of great interest.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> No specimens of teeth have been found
associated with the remains of the Hyl&aelig;osaurus, in such
manner as to afford unequivocal proof of their belonging to
that animal. But in the same quarries, teeth, decidedly of
the Lacertian structure, are occasionally found, and may
with some probability be referred to that reptile. These
teeth (see <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 6a</i></a>.) are about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch in length, and
commence at the base with a cylindrical shank, which gradually
enlarges into a crown of an obtuse lanceolate form,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691"> 691 </a></span>
convex in front, hollowed behind, and terminating in a
rounded obtusely angular apex, the margins of which are
generally more or less worn.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> The crown is solid, but the
fang encloses a small pulp-cavity; the surface is enamelled,
and covered with very fine longitudinal stri&aelig;; the base in
every specimen appears broken transversely, as if it had
been anchylosed to the jaw, or to the base of a socket. The
fang never presents an appearance of lateral adhesion, as if
belonging to a Pleurodont lizard. Sections of these teeth
expose a simple, central, medullary canal, the upper part of
which is generally filled with the ossified remains of the
pulp; and this is surrounded by a body of firm dentine,
with extremely minute calcigerous tubes radiating from the
centre to the periphery of the tooth, which is invested with
a relatively thick coat of enamel, in which no structure is
apparent. <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 6b</i></a> represents a small portion of a
vertical slice, highly magnified and viewed by transmitted
light. The reference of these dental organs to the Hyl&aelig;osaurus
must not, however, be considered as conclusive, until
confirmed by the discovery of the teeth attached to the
jaw, in connexion with other parts of the skeleton. The
locomotive organs of the Hyl&aelig;osaurus are but imperfectly
known; a perfect humerus, one phalangeal bone, and fragments
of the fibula (the small bone of the leg) are the only
bones hitherto observed. The length of this reptile, which
was probably terrestrial and herbivorous, may be estimated
at from twenty to thirty feet.</p>

of vertebrated animals in the strata of Tilgate Forest, some
teeth of a very remarkable character particularly engaged
my attention, from their dissimilarity to any that had previously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692"> 692 </a></span>
come under my notice.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> Attention having been
directed to these interesting fossils, examples were soon
discovered of teeth in various conditions, from the sharp,
unused tooth of the young reptile, to the obtuse, worn-out
crown of the adult. From the resemblance of the perfect
teeth to those of the Iguana (<a href="#lign_205"><i>Lign.</i> 205</a>, p. 649), a land
lizard of the West Indies, I proposed the name of <i>Iguanodon</i>
(signifying an animal with teeth like those of the Iguana)
for the extinct reptile to which they belonged. The numerous
bones and teeth subsequently exhumed from the strata
of Tilgate Forest and other localities in the Wealden of
Sussex and of the Isle of Wight, and the considerable portion
of the skeleton of an individual discovered by Mr.
Bensted in the Kentish Rag, have supplied the data upon

unknown, yet the half of a lower jaw, discovered in Sussex
by Capt. L. Brickenden,<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> and a fragment of an upper jaw,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695"> 695 </a></span>
idea of the structure and functions of the dental organs of the
Iguanodon. The unused tooth of this reptile is characterized
by the prismatic form of the crown, the presence of from two
to four longitudinal ridges on its enamelled face, the denticulated
margins (<a href="#lign_221"><i>Lign.</i> 221</a>, <i>a</i>), and finely serrated edge of
the summit, as seen in <a href="#lign_220"><i>Lign.</i> 220</a>,
 <i>fig.</i> 3. The shank or fang
of the tooth (<i>Ligns.</i> <a href="#lign_221">221</a>, <a href="#lign_223">223,
<i>fig.</i> 2</a>) is sub-cylindrical, slightly
curved, and tapers to a point.
The inner surface of the crown
in the lower teeth, and the
outer surface in the upper, are
covered with a thick layer of
enamel, but the opposite face
of the crown and the sides have
but a thin coating of this substance.
The teeth of the upper
jaw (<a href="#lign_222"><i>Lign.</i> 222</a>) are curved in
the opposite direction to those
of the lower, and have the
convexity external, and the
concavity internal. Thus the
upper and lower molars were
related to each other nearly as
in the Ruminants; the outer aspect below corresponding
to the inner above (see <i>Petrif.</i> <i>Lign.</i> 56, p. 254). The
specimens met with have almost always the apex of the
crown more or less worn down by use<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> (see <a href="#lign_223"><i>Lign.</i> 223</a>), and
presenting an oblique, triangular, smooth surface, as in the
fine large specimen figured in <a href="#lign_221"><i>Lign.</i> 221</a>, which was found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696"> 696 </a></span>
imbedded in the trunk of a Clathraria, as if it had snapped
off while the animal was in the act of gnawing the tough
stem. The denticulated margins are well developed; in
<i>fig.</i> 1, they appear as simple serrations; but viewed laterally,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697"> 697 </a></span>
they are seen to be formed by a series of denticulated
plates (<a href="#lign_223"><i>Lign.</i> 223</a>, <i>fig.</i> 6). The crown of a tooth of a young
animal, worn at the summit, and presenting but three longitudinal
ridges, is represented <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 4a</i></a>. The microscropical
structure consists of a simple pulp-cavity in the
centre of a body of dentine permeated by calcigerous tubes,
but with this peculiar modification, that the dentine is traversed
by vascular canals, radiating at definite intervals
from the pulp-cavity nearly to the periphery of the tooth,
and running parallel with the calcigerous tubes; thus constituting
a softer and coarser dentine than in the other
reptiles, and resembling that which characterizes the teeth
of some of the herbivorous mammals.<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> The crown of the
tooth is covered with a layer of enamel, which is thickest
on the external surface: and the fang is invested with
cement. The structure here described is shown in <i><a href="#Plate_VI">Pl. VI.</a>;
fig. 4b</i>, a vertical, and <i>fig. 4c</i>, a transverse section of a tooth,
seen by transmitted light, with a high magnifying power.
The calcigerous tubes are <sup>1</sup>/<sub>25000</sub> an inch in diameter.
Sections of the teeth of the Iguanodon are beautiful objects
under the microscope, for the medullary canals are generally
of a deep yellowish brown colour.</p>

<p>The dentine is less vascular, and therefore hardest, on that
side of the crown which has the thicker coat of enamel;
hence the tooth wears away faster on one side than on the
other, and an oblique grinding surface, with a sharp edge of
enamel, is maintained until the crown is worn away. The
internal structure of the teeth of the Iguanodon is thus in
perfect accordance with their external configuration, and
must have been admirably adapted, in every stage, for the
laceration and comminution of the tough vegetable substances

224.&mdash;The remains of the vertebral column of the Iguanodon,
consisting generally of broken and water-worn
dorsal and caudal vertebr&aelig;, deprived of their processes and
reduced to the state of the specimens represented <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>,
 <i>figs.</i> 6 and 8, are so abundant in some of the Wealden
strata, that a short account of their characters may be
useful. A reference to <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, and its description, will
render the following remarks intelligible to the general
reader. The vertebr&aelig; of the Iguanodon are distinguishable
from those of other reptiles which occur in the same strata
by the following peculiarities, which the figure of a perfect
specimen of a caudal vertebra (<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign. 206</i></a>, <i>fig.</i> 3) will serve to
illustrate. The body, or centrum, is either flat or somewhat
depressed on both articular faces; its sides are nearly flat, or
somewhat convex, vertically (as in <i>fig</i> 3), and slightly concave
lengthwise, or from front to back: in some examples,
the body is more contracted towards the inferior surface, as
in <i>fig.</i> 6; and in the vertebr&aelig;, near the middle of the tail, the
sides are compressed, so as to give an angular contour and
somewhat vertical elongation to the face, as in <i>fig.</i> 4; but
in the dorsal vertebr&aelig;, the articular faces are nearly circular,
but somewhat higher than wide. In the caudal
vertebr&aelig;, the inferior angles of the body are truncated
(<i>w</i>, <i>figs.</i> 3, 4), and present an oblique, smooth face, to
articulate with the chevron bone (<i>fig.</i> 3, <i>f</i>). The annular
part is united to the body by suture (<i>fig.</i> 3, <i>o</i>), and anchylosed
in the dorsal vertebr&aelig;; and in these bones the neural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699"> 699 </a></span>
arch is very high, and greatly expanded, and its bases
extend transversely inwards, and join each other below the
spinal canal, forming a ring, or bony channel, to contain
the spinal chord.<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> "The transverse processes are straight,
and very long in the vertebr&aelig; from the middle of the
trunk, indicating a considerable expanse of the abdominal
cavity, adapted for the lodgment of the capacious viscera of
a herbivorous quadruped." (<i>Owen.</i>) The spinous processes
(<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, <i>fig.</i> 3, <i>d</i>) are large and of great height
in the anterior caudal vertebr&aelig;, <a href="#lign_224"><i>Lign.</i> 224</a>; and here the
chevrons, or h&aelig;mapophyses (<a href="#lign_224"><i>Lign.</i> 224</a>, <i>b</i>, and <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>,
<i>fig.</i> 2, and <i>fig.</i> 3, <i>f</i>), are also of considerable length; the
bases of the latter are always united (<a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2, <i>g</i>),
and often blended, so as to form but one face for articulation
with the truncated inferior angles of the body of the
vertebra:, leaving a vertically elongated channel for the
passage of the large blood-vessels of the tail. The external
surface of the vertebr&aelig; of the Iguanodon is more or less
marked with fine longitudinal stri&aelig;; those of the Megalosaurus
have a smoother and more polished surface.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>An entire thigh-bone of an adult Iguanodon, from the

inches in length.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> end thirty-five inches in circumference at

that is but five inches long.
The form of the thigh-bone is
so peculiar, that fragments may
easily be recognised. The head
of the femur (<a href="#lign_225"><i>Lign.</i> 225</a>, <i>f</i>,) is
hemispherical, and projects inwards;
there is no appearance
of a <i>ligamentum teres</i>; a flattened
process or trochanter
(<a href="#lign_225"><i>Lign.</i> 225</a>, <i>a</i>,) forms the external
boundary of the neck of
the bone, from which it is separated
by a deep and narrow
vertical fissure; the shaft is
of a sub-quadrangular shape,
and a slightly elevated ridge,
produced by the union of two
broad, flat, longitudinal surfaces,
extends down the middle
of the anterior face, and, diverging
towards the inner condyle,
gradually disappears. The
bone terminates below in two
large condyles, separated in
front and behind by a deep,
narrow cleft, or groove (<a href="#lign_225"><i>Lign.</i> 225</a>,
 <i>e</i>). Near the middle of
the inner edge of the shaft,
there is a compressed ridge,
with an angular projection, or
trochanter. Thus the upper
part of the femur maybe known
by the presence of the flattened,
or laterally compressed trochanter;
and if that process
be wanting, a fractured surface indicating its position may
be detected; the middle of the shaft is characterized by its
broad angular faces, and the inner submedian trochanter:
the condyloid or inferior extremity of the bone may be distinguished
by the deep groove between the condyles, both
in front and behind.</p>

<p>The estimated extent of the tail has been subject to
variation. My early estimate of its length gave rise to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704"> 704 </a></span>
idea of this reptile having attained seventy feet in length.
Professor Owen, however, considered that the abbreviated
character of the anterior caudal vertebr&aelig; indicated a far
less extent of tail, which the Professor estimated at thirteen
feet; this opinion, from the evidence then before us, seemed
well founded, but from evidence since afforded by a series
of eleven caudal vertebra, belonging to the middle region
of the tail, that have been lately discovered, (<i>Petrif.</i> p. 312,)
it is not at all improbable, that, instead of all the caudal
vertebr&aelig; being abbreviated, these elements of the tail were
elongated as in the corresponding part of the skeleton of
the Iguana, and that the largest Iguanodons may have
attained a length of from sixty to seventy feet.</p>


<p>The author&#8217;s physiological inferences as to the structure
and economy of the Iguanodon, deduced from the study of
the osseous remains of this singular creature, especially the
lately discovered remains of the jaw-bones, are given in full
at pp. 307-313 <i>Petrif.</i> or <i>Foss. Brit. Mus.</i>: and at pp.
335-338, <i>ibid.</i> may be found some general remarks on the
physical geography and the nature of the fauna and flora
of the country inhabited by these stupendous reptiles,
whose remains are so characteristic of the Wealden rocks.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Jaw of the Regnosaurus.</span> (<i>Petrif.</i> p. 333.)&mdash;A portion
of the right ramus, or side, of the lower jaw of this reptile
was discovered in a block of sandstone from Tilgate Forest.
It consists of a fragment, six inches long, of the dentary
bones, with a small portion of the opercular; and it contains
the fangs of fifteen teeth, which are closely and evenly set
in a regular series, and imbedded laterally in grooves, or
sockets, in the dentary bone; there are three or four
sockets of successional teeth on the inner side of the bases
of the old teeth. (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1841, pl. v. figs. 1, 2.)
Unfortunately, all the crowns of the teeth are wanting.
The outer parapet of the dentary piece is entire, and its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705"> 705 </a></span>
upper margin is finely crenated. All the fangs of the teeth
are exposed, but there are traces of a thin inner wall, indicating
the probability that, as in the Megalosaurus, the
teeth were supported medially by an osseous plate, and
were implanted in distinct sockets.<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> In my memoir on
this fossil jaw in the <i>Phil. Trans.</i> (1841, p. 131), I referred
it to the genus Iguanodon; but subsequent observations
have led me to conclude that it is generically distinct;
and in my Memoir on the Jaw of the Iguanodon, in <i>Phil.
Trans.</i> 1848 (p. 183), I have proposed for the animal to
which it belonged the distinct generic appellation, <span class="smcap">Regnosaurus</span>,

<div class="sidenote">LACERTIAN REPTILES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="IV_Lacertian_Reptiles"></a>IV. Lacertian Reptiles.</span>&mdash;The recent Lacertians, or
true Lizards, are smaller and less highly organized reptiles
than the Saurians of the Crocodilian order; and their
dermal covering consists of a finer and more delicate
squamous integument. They are also characterized by important
modification in their osteological structure. The
spinal column is almost always composed of concavo-convex
vertebr&aelig;, with the convexity behind; the ribs are slender
and rounded, having a single convex tubercle of attachment.
The fossil species are, for the most part, of gigantic dimensions,
and deviate in a striking manner from any that now
exist. Vertebr&aelig; of the recent lacertian type are very rare
in the secondary strata; I believe a few in my cabinet,
obtained from the sandstone of Tilgate Forest, and which
belonged to a very small unknown reptile, are the most
ancient examples at present known.</p>

<p>The teeth are large, and supported on expanded conical
osseous eminences, which are anchylosed to the alveolar
ridge of the jaw (<i>acrodont</i>).
The crown of the tooth is
conical and recurved, with the
outer face nearly flat, and this
space is bordered on each side
by a longitudinal ridge; giving
the tooth somewhat of a pyramidal
figure. (See <i>Ligns.</i> <a href="#lign_228">228-230</a>.) Professor Owen states
that the crown consists of a
body of simple and firm dentine,
with fine and close-set
calcigerous tubes, enclosing a
simple pulp-cavity; irregular
processes of the latter extend
as medullary canals into the
conical base of the tooth, but
not, as in the Iguanodon, into

dentine; the dentine is invested with a moderately thick

described a splendid fossil, consisting of a portion of the
lower jaw of an acrodont reptile, with teeth, obtained by

<p>Prof. Owen in 1840 (<i>Odontog.</i> p. 261), and in 1841
(<i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> p. 144), described and figured some teeth
from the same specimen, which were lent by Mr. Charlesworth.
These teeth the Hunterian Professor regarded as
characteristic of a new genus of Mosasauroid reptile, to
which he gave the name <i>Leiodon</i> (in allusion to the smoothness
of the teeth). In 1845 (<i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> p. 60) Mr.
Charlesworth noticed, and in 1846 (<i>London Geol. Journal</i>,
p. 23, plates iv. and vi.) figured and described, the above mentioned
portion of jaw with teeth, under the name
<i>Mosasaurus stenodon</i>; and in 1851 Prof. Owen figured and
described this specimen under the name of <i>Leiodon anceps</i>,
which was originally proposed for the animal, as known
from its teeth, in 1840.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710"> 710 </a></span></p>

<p>The portion of bone on which the teeth, five in number
are implanted is seven inches in length, and is, in Professor
Owen s opinion, the dentary piece of the lower jaw, and not
a portion of a pterygoid bone. Mr. Charlesworth has had
a section made of four of the teeth, and finds that the
pulp-cavities are more or less occupied with solid cones of
silex, which must have permeated the osseous parietes of
the teeth.</p>

<p>The teeth of Leiodon have a simple pulp-cavity, surrounded
by fine dentine, with an external layer of smooth enamel.
The apex of the crown is sharp-pointed; the body of the
crown is slightly recurved; its base is expanded into a thick
circular fang, which is anchylosed to a short conical process
of the alveolar border of the jaw: the teeth differ from those
of the Mosasaurus in having the outer side as convex as the
inner side, the transverse section being an ellipse with
pointed ends, which latter correspond with the lateral
trenchant edges of the crown of the tooth: the teeth are
more closely set than in the Mosasaur and Geosaur.

ten feet. The eyes had a circle of osseous plates in the <i>sclerotica</i>,

alveolar parapet of bone, as in the Iguana, thus corresponding
with the pleurodont Lizards, is described under this
name by Professor Owen, (<i>Geol. Trans.</i> 2d ser. vol. vi.
pl. xxxix.); and <i>Monog. Cret. Rept.</i> (Pal. Soc.) 1851, p. 19,
pl. x. figs. 5, 6. It is from the Lower Chalk, near Cambridge,
and is in the collection of James Carter, Esq. of that
place. Remains of Raphiosaurus have been found also in
the Chalk at Northfleet, Kent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dolichosaurus longicollis.</span>&mdash;In the Chalk of Kent was
found, some years since, a considerable portion of the
skeleton of a lacertian reptile, consisting of the posterior
half of the spinal column, with remains of the pelvic and
thigh bones; it was figured in the <i>Geol. Trans.</i> 2d ser.
vol. vi. pl. xxxix.; and is now in the collection of Sir P. G.
Egerton. From the researches of the late Mr. Dixon, it
appears that a mutilated reptilian head and anterior portion
of a spinal column, with fore-arm and scapular bones, now
in the collection of Mr. Smith, of Tunbridge Wells, belong
to the same skeleton as the vertebral remains above mentioned.
Both specimens were obtained at the same time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712"> 712 </a></span>
from the well-known chalk-pit at Burham, Kent. Professor
Owen has lately described these interesting remains in
detail (<i>Monog. Cret. Rept.</i> 1851, pp. 22, &amp;c.), and finds no
intrinsic contradiction to exist to the historical evidence
adduced as to the probability of the two moieties having
belonged to the same individual. In the two specimens
there exist sixty-three concavo-convex (<i>proc&#339;lian</i>) vertebr&aelig;,
of which fifty-seven form the series between the skull and
the pelvis, giving the trunk a length of about eighteen
inches. This unique reptile was elongate and snake-like in
its form, with the abdomen deep and narrow, like that of
the water-snakes: its limbs were short; its tail, from the
character of the few caudal vertebr&aelig; remaining, must have
been relatively long and powerful. This long and slender
lacertian was therefore probably to a considerable degree
aquatic in its habits, swimming with an undulatory eel-like
movement.</p>

<p>The Dolichosaurus (<i>long-lizard</i>) presents somewhat of
the ophidian character in the number and size of its cervical
vertebr&aelig;, in the size and shape of its ribs, and in the slender
proportions of its trunk and head; but, with these partial
exceptions, its affinities are truly lacertian. (Owen.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rhynchosaurus articeps.</span> <a href="#lign_231"><i>Lign.</i> 231</a>.&mdash;In a quarry of
Upper New Red Sandstone at Grinsell, near Shrewsbury,
Dr. O. Ward discovered a skull (3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches long), vertebr&aelig;,
ribs, bones of the pectoral and pelvic arches, portions of two
femora with medullary cavities, and fragments of other bones
of a very remarkable lacertian reptile (<a href="#lign_231"><i>Lign.</i> 231</a>). The
lower jaw is preserved with the skull in its natural position.
The cranium in its general aspect resembles that of a turtle,
rather than of a lizard; for the intermaxillary bones are
double, as in Chelonians, and symmetrical, and are not
united by a median process; they are very long, and curve
downwards, giving the fore part of the skull the profile of a
parrot. See <a href="#lign_231"><i>Lign.</i> 231</a>.</p>

<p>There are no teeth apparent in either jaw: the margin of
the upper maxillary has feeble dentations, but in the lower
jaw even these indications are wanting, and it is probable
that this reptile had its jaws encased by a bony or horny
sheath, as in birds and turtles.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> (Owen.)</p>

348, 349.&mdash;Numerous bones and teeth of reptiles occur in
the Magnesian Conglomerate, near Bristol, and have been
described by Dr. Riley and Mr. Stutchbury in an interesting
memoir to which reference should be made for details (<i>Geol.
Trans.</i> 2d ser. vol. v. p. 349, pl. xxix. xxx.). The bones
denote an approach to the lizards; the teeth are implanted
in sockets; these reptiles, therefore, belonged to the group
termed thecodont, and the name <i>Thecodontosaurus</i>, given to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714"> 714 </a></span>
these extinct Saurians by Dr. Riley, has reference to this
character. The teeth are pointed, compressed laterally,
slightly convex on each side, with a trenchant, finely serrated
edge in front and behind; the fang is sub-cylindrical. Other
teeth from the same deposit, possessing the same general
characters, but distinguished by peculiarities of form, have
been referred to another genus, named <i>Pal&aelig;osaurus</i>. The
vertebr&aelig; found associated with the teeth and jaws are biconcave,
and are remarkably characterized by the great depth
of the spinal canal in the middle of the centrum or body of
the vertebr&aelig;, so that the spinal chord must have presented
a moniliform or bead-like appearance. These reptiles, in
their <i>thecodont</i> type of dentition, biconcave vertebr&aelig;, double-headed
ribs, and proportionate size of the bones of the extremities,
are nearly allied to the <i>Teleosaurus</i>, (see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_679">p. 679</a>);
but they combine a lacertian form of tooth, and a lacertian
structure of the pectoral, and probably of the pelvic arches,
with these crocodilian characters; they have also distinctive
modifications: such, for example, as the moniliform spinal
chord.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a></p>

reptile was discovered, by Mr. Bain, in South Africa. It is
distinguished, by some remarkable peculiarities of structure,
from other animals of the Saurian order; of which it represents
a new tribe, or sub-order. The cranium is narrow;
the nostrils are divided, as in Lizards, and not confluent, as
in Chelonia; the skull, in other respects, much resembles in
general appearance that of a Turtle; the orbits are large;
the jaws are edentulous, as in the Turtles, with the exception
of a pair of long tusks,<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> implanted in sockets in the
upper maxillary bone, like those of the Walrus; these tusks
are of a finer texture than that of the Crocodile&#8217;s teeth, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715"> 715 </a></span>
almost as dense as in the Hy&aelig;na. These creatures present
in the most striking manner that blending of the peculiarities
of several existing orders, which is continually presented
to the pal&aelig;ontologist; for with a type essentially
lacertian are combined crocodilian and chelonian modifications.
Although no vestiges of these reptiles have been discovered
in England or in Europe, yet the occurrence of an
allied form, the <i>Rhynchosaurus</i> (<a href="#lign_231"><i>Lign.</i> 231</a>), in our New Red
Sandstone, and the probability that the South African reptiliferous
deposits may, from their position, belong to the
Triassic Epoch, induce me to give a somewhat extended
notice of these extraordinary fossils: and I am led to do so
on another account, namely, because the memoir,<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> of which
the following is a brief abstract, is so excellent an example
of the manner in which such investigations should be conducted,
so as to arrive at any satisfactory conclusions as to
the characters and relations of the lost types of beings,
whose fragmentary and petrified relics are the only vestiges
that remain.</p>

<p>The most striking character in these crania is the presence
of a pair of long, sharp-pointed, gently curved tusks, implanted
in the superior maxillary bones, and which descend,
one on each side of the fore-part of the lower jaw, as seen
in <i>Ligns.</i> <a href="#lign_232">232</a> and <a href="#lign_233">233</a>, <i>t</i>, <i>t&#8242;</i>. This is a dental character
which, with this exception, is peculiar to the mammalia (the
Walrus, Musk-deer, and Machairodus), and is rare even in
that class.</p>

<p><i>Examination of the skull.</i>&mdash;One of the crania showed the
median undivided process of a single <i>intermaxillary</i> bone,
ascending and separating <i>two distinct anterior nasal apertures</i>;
in another, the boundaries of a very much contracted
cranial cavity were evident: these characters
combined to prove that the skulls were referable to air-breathing
oviparous and cold-blooded animals, or Reptiles;
but neither to Crocodilians nor Chelonians, and for the
following reasons:&mdash;</p>

<p>1stly. The originals were not mammalians; for no
mammalian has the <i>intermaxillary bone single</i> (as in <a href="#lign_233"><i>Lign.</i> 233</a>,
 <i>a</i>), or the <i>external bony nasal aperture double</i>; and
neither mammalian nor bird has the cavity for the brain so
relatively small as in this fossil.</p>

<p>2dly. They were not Crocodiles; for in all crocodiles the
intermaxillary bone is divided by a suture, and the anterior
nasal aperture is single and on the median line, as in
mammalia.</p>

<p>3dly. They were not Chelonians; for all turtles have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_718" id="Page_718"> 718 </a></span>
nasal opening single and placed in the middle of the fore-part
of the skull, in the very situation which, in the Dicynodon,
is occupied by the convex imperforate median plate
of the broad intermaxillary bone.</p>

<p>4thly. They could not be Fishes, as those animals have
no well-defined external respiratory nasal apertures.</p>

<p>5thly. They were neither Batrachians (frogs) nor Ophidians
(serpents); for, although the reptiles of these two
orders have a single intermaxillary and double nostrils, like
the fossils, the latter are at once separated from them by the
presence of a strong and complete zygomatic arch (<i>Ligns.</i>
<a href="#lign_232">232</a> and <a href="#lign_233">233</a>, <i>g</i>, <i>d</i>), continued from the tympanic bone to
the large immovably articulated superior maxillary.</p>

<p>Lastly, the characters last named, and the presence of
vertical tympanic pedicles (<a href="#lign_232"><i>Lign.</i> 232</a>, <i>l</i>), suspended by their
upper part to the junction of the zygomatic and mastoid
bones, prove the affinity to the lacertians or true lizards.</p>

<p>These bidental crania have certain characters in common
with that of the Rhynchosaur, which is also, as we have
before seen, of the true lacertian group, but the Dicynodonts
are more nearly allied to the Crocodiles and the Chelonians
than the Rhynchosaurus appears to be.</p>

<p>Referring to the original Memoir for anatomical details,
I must limit this notice to a few additional general remarks.
Both the jaws are edentulous, with the exception of the pair
of tusks, as in Chelonians; there are no traces of teeth, or of
their sockets, in the lower jaw, which is short and very deep,
and anchylosed at the symphysis, as in turtles; the alveolar
border forms a smooth trenchant edge, which shuts within
the corresponding part of the upper jaw: it is probable that
both jaws were covered by horn, as in the chelonians. The
tusks are implanted in wide and deep conical alveoli in the
suborbital part of the maxillary bone, and project about two
inches beyond the sockets (<a href="#lign_232"><i>Lign.</i> 232</a>); they are long and
pointed, and are directed downwards and forwards, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719"> 719 </a></span>
slight backward curve, and slightly converge towards their
extreme points (<a href="#lign_233"><i>Lign.</i> 233</a>). These teeth consist of a simple
body of unvascular dentine, with a very thin external coat
of enamel. The tooth-ivory is more dense than in any known
reptile, and approaches in its intimate texture that of the
canines of the carnivorous mammals. The base of the tooth
has a conical cavity (<a href="#lign_234"><i>Lign.</i> 234</a>), indicating a persistent
matrix or dental pulp, the
rest of the tooth without the
socket being solid. There
are no traces whatever of
the germs of successional
teeth. It is therefore inferred,
that, like the tusks
and scalpriform incisors of
mammalia, the canine or
maxillary teeth of the Dicynodon
were capable of
constant growth and renovation;
thus offering an
approach to the typical
dentition of mammalia, unknown
in any other reptiles.</p>

<p>As the points of the teeth in the only known perfect specimen
are unworn, it is inferred that these tusks were not
employed either as instruments for obtaining food, as in the
Dugong, or for locomotion, as in the Walrus, but were
simply offensive and defensive weapons.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>By reference to <a href="#lign_235"><i>Lign.</i> 235</a>, it will be seen that the cranium
is almost wholly lost; a few conical teeth, mostly of a very
small size, were observed in connexion with the vestige of
the jaws. The spinal column is represented by the impressions
of about thirty-six vertebr&aelig;, eleven or twelve of
which belong to its caudal portion. The vertebr&aelig; present
some faint evidence of their possessing a biconcave form;
the length of one of the dorsal vertebr&aelig; is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub>th of an inch.
There are twenty-one pairs of long slender ribs. The pectoral
arch and anterior extremities have nearly disappeared
in the fracture of the stone. The pelvis and sacrum are
very obscure; the latter is formed probably of two anchylosed
vertebra;. The thigh-bones are somewhat curved; the
tibia is gently bowed, and expanded at each extremity.
There are no remains of the feet.</p>

<p>The structure of this reptilian skeleton, as far as the specimen
can serve to show, indicates a peculiar type of organization,
in which, as in numerous other extinct forms, in
this, as in other Classes, osteological characters are associated
which in existing oviparous quadrupeds are restricted to
distinct orders and genera.</p>

Outline of the restored form of the original reptile: <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>nat.</i></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>lacertian</i> affinities
of the Telerpeton
are well marked
in the relative size
and form of the bones
of its extremities, the
situation of its pelvis,
and probably in the
articulation and the
length of its ribs; but
the contracted, biconcave
centrum, and the
short neural spine of
the vertebr&aelig;, as well
as the horizontality of
the articulating surfaces of the zygapophyses,
and the general
uniformity of
character throughout
the spinal column, are
to be regarded as <i>batrachian</i>
modifications. Probably the original was a peculiar
type, which, in the present state of our knowledge, it would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723"> 723 </a></span>
be rash to ascribe to either order. The length of the
original animal could not have exceeded six or seven inches.
<a href="#lign_236"><i>Lign.</i> 236</a> represents in outline the probable form of this

<i>Wond.</i> p. 577; <i>Bd.</i> pl. xxi. xxii.&mdash;The extinct reptiles
denominated Pterodactyles, constituting a few genera of
an order of Saurians organized for a&euml;rial life,<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a> are unquestionably
the most marvellous even of the wonderful
beings which the relics of the Age of Reptiles have enabled
the pal&aelig;ontologist to reconstruct. With a long-snouted
head and long neck, much resembling that of a bird, bat-like
wings, and a small trunk and tail, with lacertian
affinities in its skull, teeth, and skeleton, and with a bird-like
structure of sternum and scapular arch, these creatures
present an anomaly of structure as unlike their fossil
contemporaries, as is the duck-billed Ornithorhynchus, of
Australia, to existing animals. The cranium, or brain-case,
is small; the jaws are either long, and armed with numerous
sharp-pointed teeth, or toothless, like those of a bird.
The teeth of the Pterodactyle are all laniary; they are
simple, of a conical form, recurved, with but little difference
in their form and size, and implanted in distinct
sockets, with wide intervals between each. In some species
there are twenty-eight or thirty in the lower, and twenty-two
in the upper jaw.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_674" id="Footnote_674"></a><a href="#FNanchor_674"><span class="label">[674]</span></a> The only known recent reptile at all analogous is the little
<i>Draco volans</i> of the East Indian Islands; but even this can scarcely
be regarded as a flying animal, its lateral membranous expansions,
which are rather parachutes than wings, and formed by elongated
ribs, not by the fingers, presenting but a rudimentary condition of
wings compared with those of the Bat and the Pterodactyle.</p></div>

<p>The orbit is very large; the sclerotica consists of an
annular row of bony plates, but less in number than in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724"> 724 </a></span>

have been observed.</p>

</div>

<p>The cervical vertebr&aelig; are large and strong, and capable
of great flexibility forwards and backwards, probably to
allow the head to fall back to the centre of gravity during
flight. There are frequently traces of ossified condition of
the tendons of the muscles of the neck. This is well seen
in <i>P. macronyx</i> and <i>P. crassirostris</i> (<a href="#lign_237"><i>Lign.</i> 237</a>), and is a
peculiarity dependent on the additional support required
by the long neck of the animal.</p>

<p>The dorsal vertebr&aelig; are from seventeen to twenty in
number. The sacrum is formed by the coalescence of two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725"> 725 </a></span>
vertebr&aelig; only, as in existing reptiles, and not of many, as
in birds and certain extinct saurians. The tail is generally
short, an unusual character with saurians; but a species
with a long tail occurs at Solenhofen.</p>

<p>There are five toes or digits on each foot; the outer
finger of the fore-arm is immensely elongated, for the
support of a membranous expansion (the impression of this
wing-membrane is preserved on the stone in some examples);
and the other digits, of fore and hind feet, terminated in
long curved claws. The size and form of the extremities
show that the <i>Pterodactylus</i> was capable of perching on
trees, of hanging against perpendicular surfaces, and of
standing firmly on the ground, when, with its wings folded,
it might crawl on all-fours, and walk or hop like a bird.
A reference to the graphic description of the characters and
probable habits of these beings, by Dr. Buckland, <i>Bd.</i> i.
p. 221, and the beautiful illustrations accompanying it
(<i>Bd.</i> ii. pl. xxi. xxii.), will equally instruct and gratify the
reader.</p>

<p>The most perfect examples of the <i>Pterodactyles</i> have been
discovered in the lithographic stone of Monheim, Pappenheim,
and Solenhofen, where their bones are associated with
the remains of <i>Dragon-flies</i> (see <a href="#Page_551">p. 551</a>) and other insects.
In England, bones of these reptiles have been obtained from
the Lias of Lyme Regis, from the Oolitic slate of Stonesfield,
from the Wealden strata of Tilgate Forest, and the Chalk
of Kent.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> One of the most interesting British specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726"> 726 </a></span>

Anning, in the Lias of Lyme Regis, and now deposited in
the British Museum.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a> It consists of the principal bones of
the extremities, and of several vertebra:, and is figured and
described by Dr. Buckland, <i>Geol. Trans.</i> 2d ser. vol. iii.

<p>The remains of the Pterodactyles of the Chalk, for the
most part, indicate a large size for the original animals. It
has been estimated that some of these gigantic flying reptiles
possessed an extent of wing surpassing that of the great
albatross. The <i>Pterodactylus Cuvieri</i> had probably an
expanse of wing not less than eighteen feet from tip to tip;
another Chalk species, <i>P. compressirostris</i>, fifteen feet; whilst
the <i>P. macronyx</i>, of the Lias, measured about four feet seven
inches from the extremity of one wing to that of the other.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CHELONIANS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="VI_Chelonian_Reptiles"></a>VI. Chelonian Reptiles.</span>&mdash;Those singular reptiles, commonly
known by the name of Tortoises and Turtles, and
designated by naturalists <span class="smcap">Chelonia</span> (from <i>Chelone</i>, the Greek
term for a Tortoise), are distinguished from all other animals
by the osseous cuirass in which their bodies are enclosed,
the head and neck, extremities, and tail, alone being excluded.
This remarkable bony case is produced by the
extraordinary development of the bones of the thorax and
back; and consists of an under (<i>sternal</i>) and an upper
(<i>dorsal</i>) portion. The breast-plate, or <i>plastron</i>, which is
the true sternum, is composed of nine pieces of bone, eight
of which are in pairs, and the ninth, or odd plate, is situated
between the four anterior plates. The variation in the
form of these plates is considerable, and affords important
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727"> 727 </a></span>
distinctive characters. In the young state of land and
fresh-water tortoises, there are vacancies between the pieces,
which are filled up in the adult, the whole being ultimately
united into one bony plate; but in the marine turtles (and
also in the <i>Trionyces</i>, or soft tortoises), these pieces do not
completely unite, and interspaces always remain. The
bones of which the dorsal buckler, <i>carapace</i>, or upper shield
is composed consist of eight of the ten pairs of ribs, united
by a longitudinal series of angular plates, which are attached
to the annular part of the vertebra throughout the whole,
or a great part of their length, according to the age and
species of the individual.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> Numerous modifications exist
in the form of the buckler, in its flatness or convexity, in
the degree of extension of the ribs, and their angular plates,
and in the characters of the scutes or horny integument
with which the carapace is covered; and with corresponding
variations in the head, and in the locomotive extremities,
in the numerous species and genera of the Chelonian reptiles,
according to their adaptation to a terrestrial, fluviatile,
or marine existence.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_678" id="Footnote_678"></a><a href="#FNanchor_678"><span class="label">[678]</span></a> In the Monograph on Eocene Reptiles, 1849, Prof. Owen has
given a succinct account of the carapace and plastron of the <i>Chelone</i>,
and a brief notice of the composition and homologies of these bony
encasements in the Tortoise, with references to more particular and
comprehensive memoirs by himself and others.</p></div>

<p>The animals of this order are arranged in four principal
groups, viz. the marine, or Turtles (<i>Chelones</i>); the fluviatile,
or river-Tortoises (<i>Trionyces</i>); the marsh-Tortoises (<i>Emydes</i>);
and the terrestrial or land-Tortoises (<i>Testudines</i>). The marine
Chelonians generally feed upon vegetables; the <i>Emys</i> and
<i>Trionyx</i> approach more nearly to the terrestrial than to the
marine species; they are carnivorous, feeding on frogs,
fishes, fresh-water mollusca, and other small animals. The
<i>Trionyces</i> differ from their congeners in being destitute of
a horny external integument, having no scutes on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728"> 728 </a></span>
buckler or any other part of the body but the osseous
carapace is invested with a strong tough skin, which equally
covers the dorsum and sternum, to which it firmly adheres;
the dermal surface of the bones in these Tortoises is always
rugose, and either granulated, or covered with punctations
and depressions. The buckler of the Trionyces is of a
depressed form, with a soft flattened margin. The Testudinid&aelig;,
or land-Tortoises, are too well known to render
any description requisite for our present purpose.</p>

<p>In the marine species, eight pairs of ribs and thirteen
plates of the longitudinal series form the buckler; the
ribs or costal plates are united to each other through a great
part of their extent; but towards their distal or outer
extremities each rib contracts, and terminates in a point,
which is supported on a marginal series of bony plates; the
intervals between the ribs are filled up in the living animal
by a cartilaginous membrane which never becomes ossified.
This character, therefore, affords an important aid in the
discrimination of the fossil remains of this family.<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_679" id="Footnote_679"></a><a href="#FNanchor_679"><span class="label">[679]</span></a> The reader will recognise this peculiarity in the gilded skeleton
of the carapace of Turtles, frequently exhibited in the soup-shops of
the metropolis.</p></div>

<p>In the terrestrial and the marsh Tortoises, the ossification
is complete in the adult state; but in the fluviatile Trionyces,
which are without a horny integument, there is no
border, or marginal series of bony plates, and the extremities
of the ribs are therefore always distinct, and generally
have an obtuse extremity. The skeletons of the three
groups present corresponding modifications, and an accurate
knowledge of the osteology of the recent animals is necessary
to enable the pal&aelig;ontologist to arrive at secure conclusions
as to the characters and relations of the fossil
species.<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> We can only advert to one remarkable osteological
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729"> 729 </a></span>
character,&mdash;the construction of the shoulder, which
differs from that of all other animals, in being situated
within the cavity of the thorax, instead of without. In
consequence of this modification, a process of the shoulder-blade
(<i>scapula</i> or <i>omoplate</i>), termed the <i>acromion</i>, is largely
developed, and the shoulder-bone is tri-mucronate, or three-pronged,
consisting of a short, thick head, containing a concavity
(which, with that on the coracoid-bone, forms a
socket for the arm-bone), and of two diverging branches.
This form is so peculiar, that the collector can be at no loss
to recognise the shoulder-bone of a <i>Chelonian</i>, should it
come under his notice with other fossil relics (see <i>Foss. Til.
For.</i> pl. xix. <i>fig.</i> 11). The shoulder-blade and its associated
coracoid-bone undergo certain modifications in the
three groups of Turtles, by which the anatomist may pretty
certainly determine the terrestrial, fluviatile, or marine
character of the animals to which they belonged. The successful
application of a perfect knowledge of this department
of osteology, is admirably exemplified in the works to which
reference has been made; and even but a slight acquaintance
with its principles will often enable us to obtain some
general information as to the nature and relations of fossil
Chelonians.</p>

indications of the presence of Reptiles on our planet are
afforded by the foot-prints of Chelonian animals on the
surfaces of the layers of sandstone of the Old Red formation
at Elgin, and of the New Red in Dumfriesshire, at Storeton,
near Liverpool, and at some places in Germany (see <i>Bd.</i> i.
p. 259, and p. 265, note). But no osseous remains of the
animals of this family have hitherto been found in strata
antecedent to the Oolite. The Solenhofen quarries (Kelheim)
have yielded the bones and carapaces of several
Emydian tortoises, and some remains of Chelonians have
been found at Stonesfield, and in the Portland Sandstone.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a>
In the Jura limestone at Soleure, two large species of
Emydians have been discovered. The Wealden and Purbeck
formations abound in Chelonian remains of both
fluviatile and marine genera. From the Isle of Purbeck
numerous fine examples have been obtained;<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> my own
researches in the strata of Tilgate Forest (<i>Foss. Til. For.</i>
p. 60) have also brought to light several species, and in
particular an interesting Chelonian related to the soft-skinned,
fresh-water tortoises, <i>Trionyces</i> (<i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 255).
In the Cretaceous formation of England the remains of
these reptiles are not frequent. The Greensand of Cambridgeshire
(<i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> 1841, p. 172,) has yielded a
marine species, and that of Kent a fine Emydian form
(Owen, <i>Monog.</i> 1851); and in the White Chalk a few
examples have been obtained, to which we shall hereafter
more particularly allude. On the Continent fine examples
have been found in the slate of Glaris (see <i>Bd.</i> pl. xxv&#8242;.);
and in the upper Cretaceous strata of the Netherlands, at
Maestricht, and at Melsbroeck, near Brussels, many beautiful
specimens of fresh-water tortoises (<i>Emydes</i>), and
marine turtles (<i>Chelones</i>), have from time to time been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731"> 731 </a></span>
obtained; these are figured and described by Baron Cuvier
(<i>Oss. Foss.</i> tom. v. pp. 236, 239). In the Eocene strata of
England, several species of Chelonians have been collected;
of these eleven belong to the marine genus <i>Chelone</i>; eight
to the fresh-water <i>Trionyx</i>; and eight to the marsh-tortoises,
<i>Emys</i> and <i>Platemys</i>. The Isle of Sheppey and
Hordwell have yielded the majority of these relics; the
turtles are smaller than the recent analogues, which now
inhabit intertropical latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> The Eocene strata of
France contain several fresh-water tortoises, some of which
are referable to the Emydes, and others to the Trionyces.
From the gypsum beds, near Paris, the remains of one or
two species of Trionyx have been obtained (<i>Oss. Foss.</i> tom. v.
p. 222), of another at Aix, in Provence, and of three or
four species in other localities. A fine specimen of fresh-water
tortoise from &#338;ningen, near Constance, is described
and figured by Professor Bell in Geol. Trans. 2d ser. vol. iii.
The fossil remains of <i>Testudinid&aelig;</i>, or land-tortoises, are
exceedingly rare. No well-determined remains are known
in the British strata; the impressions of scutes found in the
Stonesfield slate, and the foot-prints above described, being
the only indications of the existence of these reptiles. The
presence of land-tortoises in the strata of France appears
to be equally problematical, for the relics obtained from
Montmartre and Aix (<i>Oss. Foss.</i> p. 245) afford no certain
data as to the character of the original.</p>

Maidstone, whose discoveries have rendered his quarry of
Kentish Bag classic ground to the British pal&aelig;ontologist,
I am indebted for this splendid fossil turtle. The quarry
whence it was obtained is situated at Burham, a short distance
from the banks of the Medway, between Chatham and
Maidstone, and presents a good section of the lower Chalk.
This locality is rich in fossil remains, rivalling in this
respect the quarries near Lewes, Worthing, and Arundel, in
Sussex. Two other fossil Turtles have been obtained from
this quarry, and now enrich the cabinets of Sir P. Egerton
and Mr. Bowerbank. Other relics of Chelonians found in
this place are four marginal plates of the carapace, and
fragments of ribs,<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> some marginal plates of a much larger
individual, mandibles, and other fragments, which are noticed
in Prof. Owen&#8217;s Monograph, 1851. The specimen, of which
<a href="#lign_238"><i>Lign.</i> 238</a> is a reduced figure, consists of the dorsal buckler or
carapace almost entire; it is of a depressed elliptical form,
with a longitudinal median ridge; it is six inches in length,
and three and a half inches in breadth across the middle.
It is composed of eight ribs, or costal plates, on each side
the dorsal ridge, which is formed of ten neural plates; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733"> 733 </a></span>
there is a border of marginal plates. These plates are united
to each other by finely indented sutures, and bear the
imprints of the horny scutes, or tortoise-shell, with which
they were originally invested. The expanded ribs are united
throughout the proximal half of their length, and gradually
taper to their marginal extremities, which are supported by
the plates of the osseous border.<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> This description applies
to the specimen as seen in <a href="#lign_238"><i>Lign.</i> 238</a>; but Mr. Bensted so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734"> 734 </a></span>
skilfully cleared away the chalk as to admit of the removal
of a great part of the dorsal shield, by which means some
of the vertebr&aelig;, four sternal (<i>hyosternal</i> and <i>hyposternal</i>)
plates, and one of the coracoid bones are displayed. This
brief description will suffice to convey a general idea of the
characters of this fossil, which differs from any known
recent turtle, and possesses some anomalous features, that
appear to indicate some slight Emydian affinities.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the numerous fossils obtained from the Chalk of
Sussex, the only trace of a Chelonian reptile that has come
under my observation is
the bony mandible or
beak of a Turtle, <a href="#lign_239"><i>Lign.</i> 239</a>. Its surface displays
a fibrous cancellated
structure, denoting
the attachment of the
horny sheath with
which, in a recent state,
it was covered. More
or less perfect specimens
of such mandibles also
occur in the Chalk of
Kent and elsewhere, but no bones of the skull have yet
been met with in that deposit. In the Greensand of Cambridgeshire,
however, the cranium of a small turtle has
been found. It is figured and described by Prof. Owen as
<i>Chelone pulchriceps</i> (<i>Monograph</i>, 1851).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chelone Bellii</span>. <a href="#lign_240"><i>Lign.</i> 240</a>, <i>Petrif.</i> 155.&mdash;In the strata
of Tilgate Forest, fragments of the carapace, of the plastron
or sternum, and of the marginal plates, with some of the
bones of the extremities, of a large marine turtle have been
discovered; several specimens are figured in <i>Foss. Til. For.</i>
pl. vi. and vii. Some examples must have belonged to an
individual at least three feet in length. Unfortunately, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735"> 735 </a></span>
specimens hitherto obtained are very imperfect, and do not
exhibit essential distinctive characters, with the exception
of the ribs, which are united to within a short distance of
their distal or marginal extremities; hence the costal interspaces
are reduced to much smaller dimensions than in any
recent or fossil Turtles with which I have had the means of
comparing them. The fragment of a rib, imbedded in Tilgate
grit, figured <a href="#lign_240"><i>Lign.</i> 240</a>, well exhibits this character.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fossil fresh-water Tortoises.</span>&mdash;The remains of fresh-water
Tortoises, referable to the <i>Emydid&aelig;</i>, occur in the
Purbeck and Wealden strata (Owen&#8217;s <i>Monograph</i>, 1853, and
<i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> 1841); the resemblance of some of these to
the Jurassic species from Soleure was noticed by Cuvier
(<i>Oss. Foss.</i> vol. v.). Among the Chelonian remains of the
Wealden, some of the most remarkable are the costal plates
and other bones of a Tortoise, which in its essential characters
is closely allied to the Trionyces,<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> but differs from the
recent forms, in having possessed a dermal horny integument,
formed of scutes of tortoise-shell. The chelonians of
the genus Trionyx (so named from their having three claws)
have the extremities of the ribs free, and not articulated to
a border of marginal plates, and there are intervals between
their costal plates even in the adult state. The external
surface of the bones of the buckler is covered with granulations,
or with little pits, for the attachment of the soft skin,
the only integument with which these animals are invested;
and, being destitute of horny scutes, their bones exhibit no
furrows, as in the other genera. But the fossil rib-plates
(see <a href="#lign_241"><i>Lign.</i> 241</a>) have a shagreen-like or punctated surface,
like the recent Trionyces, and at the same time bear the
imprints of horny scutes; and, instead of being nearly of
an equal width throughout their entire length, as in the
existing species, have one extremity much wider than the
other, as in the land-tortoises. From the slight degree of
convexity of the ribs, it is evident that the carapace was
much flattened, as in the Trionyx.<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> Except in having a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737"> 737 </a></span>
defensive dermal integument, and agreeing in this respect
with many of the Crocodilian reptiles, with which its bones
are associated, the original must have closely resembled the
existing predaceous fresh-water soft Turtles; and, doubtless,
like those reptiles, inhabited the muddy beds of lakes and
rivers, preying upon the eggs and young of the larger
reptiles, and on the uniones and other fluviatile mollusca,
whose shells are very commonly found imbedded with its
remains.</p>

<p>The vertebr&aelig; of Serpents are distinguished by a transversely
oblong anterior concavity, forming a deep cup, and
a corresponding posterior convexity or hall; by the interlocking
of the projecting posterior oblique processes with
the anterior pair; and by the oblong tubercle on each side
of the anterior part of the body of the vertebra, for moveable
articulation with the head of the ribs; a spinal column
thus constructed combines in the highest degree perfect

<p><span class="smcap"><a id="VIII_Batrachians"></a>VIII. Batrachians.</span>&mdash;The reptiles termed <span class="smcap">Batrachians</span>
(from the Greek name for Frog) are characterized by the
metamorphoses which they undergo in the progress of their
development from the young to the adult state; the Frog,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740"> 740 </a></span>
Toad, and Newt are familiar examples of this order. Their
organs of a&euml;rial respiration consist of a pair of lungs; but
in their young state they are provided with gills, supported,
as in fishes, by cartilaginous arches. These organs disappear,
in most species, when the animals arrive at maturity; but
in a few genera, as the Siren and Proteus, they are persistent.
The skeletons of these reptiles present corresponding
modifications. The skull is, for the most part, much
depressed, and the cerebral cavity small; it is united to the
vertebral column by two distinct condyles, situated on the
sides of the occipital or cranio-spinal aperture.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> The vertebral
column, in some genera (as, for example, in the common
frog), is very short, and is reduced to eight or ten
bones, the caudal vertebr&aelig; being fused into a long cylindrical
style; but in the higher organised Batrachians the
spine is composed of concavo-convex vertebr&aelig;, as in the
Crocodile: in the lower type, as the Siren, Proteus, and
Axolotl, the vertebr&aelig; are biconcave, as in numerous species
of fossil Saurians. The ribs are merely rudimentary, being
very short and few; a condition which has relation to the
mode of reproduction in these animals, the eggs being accumulated
and shed at once.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> Some of the Batrachians are

far the most interesting evidence of the existence of Batrachian
reptiles in the earlier ages of our planet has been
afforded by Professor J&auml;ger&#8217;s discovery of the skull, teeth,
and other remains of gigantic extinct animals, allied to the

Banter Sandstein, and Keuper, <i>Quart. Geol. Journ.</i> vol. iv. pt. ii. p. 40.</p></div>

<p>These remains were referred by this eminent physician
and naturalist to saurian genera, although the double condyle
of the occipital bone indicated Batrachian affinities.
It was reserved, however, for our distinguished countryman,
Professor Owen, to correct the error into which the German
<i>savant</i> had fallen,&mdash;remove the obscurity in which the subject
was involved,&mdash;determine the natural relations of the
original,&mdash;and develope a modification of dental organization
of the most unexpected and interesting character.</p>

<p>Dr. Lloyd, of Leamington, having discovered some fossil
teeth and bones in the light-coloured sandstone of the New
Red, at Warwick and Leamington, submitted them to Professor
Owen, who, struck with their general resemblance to
the teeth of the gigantic <i>Salamandro&iuml;des</i> of Wirtemberg,
instituted a microscopic examination of the British and
German specimens. The result proved that the teeth from
both localities possessed a remarkable and complicated
structure, produced by the convergence of numerous inflected
folds of the external layer of cement towards the
pulp-cavity; to which, as we have already seen (<a href="#Page_666">p. 666</a>), a
very slight approach was made in the tooth of the Ichthyosaurus,
and a still closer approximation by the teeth of
certain fishes (<i>Lepidosteus</i>, <a href="#Page_616">p. 616</a>). From the intricate
meanderings or labyrinthine inflections observable in the
sections of these teeth, Professor Owen has given the name
of <i>Labyrinthodon</i> to these extinct Batrachian reptiles, and
has determined five British species; one of which (<i>L. J&aelig;geri</i>)
he conceives to be identical with a species described by my
friend, Dr. J&auml;ger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743"> 743 </a></span></p>

<p>The remains of the skeletons of these reptiles, hitherto
found in Warwickshire, consist of portions of the cranium,
and of the upper and lower jaws, with teeth, vertebr&aelig;, a
sternum, and some of the bones of the pelvis and the extremities.
From a specimen (of <i>L. scutulatus</i>) consisting of
an aggregated group of bones, imbedded in sandstone, comprising
four vertebr&aelig;, portions of ribs, a humerus, a thigh-bone,
and two leg-bones, with several small osseous scutes, it
appears that one species, at least, resembled the Crocodiles
in its dermal structure. But Professor Owen remarks, that
this modification of the dermal system does not affect the
claims of the Labyrinthodonts to be considered as Batrachians,
although all the known living species of this order
are covered with a soft, lubricous, naked integument; for
the skin is the seat of the most variable characters in all
animals; and the double occipital condyle, the simple lower
jaw, the palatal vomerine bones, and the teeth of these fossil
reptiles must be deemed decisive of their essentially Batrachian
nature.</p>

<p>From the specimens of the cranium the important fact
has been ascertained, that the Labyrinthodonts had subterminal
nostrils leading to a wide and shallow nasal cavity,
which is separated by a broad and almost continuous palatal
flooring from the cavity of the mouth; indicating, by its
horizontal position, that the posterior apertures were placed
far behind the external nostrils; whereas in the recent air-breathing
Batrachians the nasal canal is short and vertical,
and the inner apertures pierce the anterior part of the
palate. The nasal cavities in the Frog are vertical; for this
reptile swallows air. The Labyrinthodonts must, therefore,
have breathed air like the Crocodiles, and were probably
provided with well-developed ribs, and not mere rudimentary
styles, as in most living Batrachians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tooth of the Labyrinthodon.</span> <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 3.</i></a>&mdash;The
tooth of the Labyrinthodon is of a conical figure, very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744"> 744 </a></span>
slightly recurved, and marked externally with shallow, fine,
longitudinal strife. <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 3a</i></a>, represents (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> <i>nat. size</i>) a
specimen presented to me by Dr. J&auml;ger. The tooth is implanted,
by a single fang, in an alveolar groove to which it
is anchylosed. It consists of a simple central pulp-cavity,
surrounded by a body of dentine, which has an external
thin coat of cement; and a vertical duplication or fold of
this cement penetrates the substance of the tooth at each of
the stri&aelig;, which are arranged at intervals of about one line
around the entire circumference of the tooth. The inflected
folds of cement extend inwards towards the centre, in a
straight direction for about half a line, then become undulated,
and finally terminate in a dilatation or loop, close to
the pulp-cavity, from which it is separated by a thin layer
of dentine. Within these inflections of the cement, the
dentine, or tooth-bone, is similarly disposed; a layer of dentine
lining the folds of cement, and having corresponding
interspaces, which are filled up by the processes from the
pulp-cavity. It is this blending of the cement and dentine
in labyrinthine folds, that gives the peculiar character
observable in transverse sections of the teeth. <a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 3a</i></a>,
represents a transverse section of half the diameter of the
tooth; the vacancy in the middle of the line at the bottom
is a section of half the pulp-cavity. <i>Fig. 3b</i> is a vertical
section of a fragment near the summit of the tooth; and
<i>fig. 3c</i>, a highly-magnified view of one of the anfractuosities,
showing a fold of cement, surrounding a fold of dentine, and
in the centre of the latter the termination of a process of
the pulp. The section of the tooth of the Ichthyosaurus,
<a href="#Plate_VI"><i>Pl. VI. fig. 9</i></a>, shows the most simple modification of this
structure; the apparent complication of that of the Labyrinthodon
arises from the inflections of the three elements
of dental organization being more numerous and diversified.
But the beautiful plates and the graphic description of the
original discoverer must be seen and perused to obtain an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745"> 745 </a></span>
adequate idea of the exquisite structure of the fossil teeth;
for the distribution of the extremely minute calcigerous
tubes of the dentine is as diversified as that of the constituent
substances. And even after viewing these <i>chefs-d&#8217;&#339;uvres</i>
of structural delineations, should the reader have
an opportunity of examining a transverse section of a tooth
under the microscope, he will feel how feebly any engraving
can represent the characters of the original.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a></p>

occurrence of reptilian remains in deposits of higher
antiquity than the Triassic was first established in 1844, by
the discovery of the skull and other portions of the skeleton
of an air-breathing reptile, the <i>Apateon pedestris</i>, related to
the Salamanders, and about three feet in length, in the coal
of M&uuml;nster-Appel in Rhenish Bavaria. In 1847 Professor
Von Dechen obtained, in nodules of argillaceous ironstone,
from the coal-field of Lebach, in the district of Saarbr&uuml;ck,
three species of the same type of reptiles; these have been
described by Goldfuss, under the name of <i>Archegosaurus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>

<p>The skull and portions of the trunk of this species
(<i>A. Dechenii</i>), see <a href="#lign_244"><i>Lign.</i> 244</a>, indicate an animal three and a
half feet in length. Seventeen dorsal vertebr&aelig;, imprints
of the ribs, and remains of the extremities, have been collected.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746"> 746 </a></span>
The jaws to beyond the orbit have small fine
conical teeth, longitudinally striated. The eye was furnished
with an osseous ring. The skin, of which a considerable
part was detached, was covered by long, narrow,
wedge-shaped, horny scales, arranged in rows (<a href="#lign_244"><i>Lign.</i> 244</a>).
The cranial bones are characterized by reticulating grooves
and pittings, similar in character to the reticulate markings
on the cranial bones of the Labyrinthodon, but of a more
delicate sculpturing. The original reptiles were quadruped;
the fore and hind feet had distinct toes; but the limbs
were feeble, and only capable of swimming, or, when on
land, of a slow creeping movement.</p>

<p>The Archegosaurus is closely allied to the Labyrinthodonts;<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a>
and, in the words of Professor Owen,<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> it is
"essentially Batrachian, and most nearly allied to the
perennibranchiate, or lowest or most fish-like of that Order
of Reptiles."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_706" id="Footnote_706"></a><a href="#FNanchor_706"><span class="label">[706]</span></a> We may remark that in the opinion of Dr. Goldfuss and Von
Meyer (<i>loc. cit.</i>) the Labyrinthodon and the Archegosaurus are
saurian forms connecting the Crocodiles and the Lizards, and representing
in the ancient fauna an arrested or "permanent larva-condition
of the loricated reptiles, as the sirens do among the recent
batrachians." Professor Owen&#8217;s estimation of the affinities of these
genera is stated above, and in the <i>note</i> at p. 55, Geol. Journ. vol. iv.

1853, pp. 58-67, plates ii. and iii.)&mdash;The remains of a
reptile and a land-shell, resembling a <i>Pupa</i>, were discovered
in 1852, by Sir C. Lyell and Mr. J. W. Dawson, in the
interior of an erect stamp of a fossil tree (<i>Sigillaria</i>), in
the coal-measures at the South Joggins cliffs, Nova Scotia.
These remains were fully described by Professor Jeffries
Wyman, of Harvard University, U. S., and Professor Owen
in the Appendix to the Memoir by Sir C. Lyell and Mr.
Dawson, in the Journal of the Geological Society, vol. ix.
Some of the bones were recognised as having a near resemblance
to those of the recent <i>Menobranchus</i> and <i>Menopoma</i>
(Perennibranchiate Batrachians, inhabiting North
American fresh-waters); the sculptured cranial bones are
analogous to those of the <i>Labyrinthodon</i> and <i>Archegosaurus</i>;
and the teeth have a Labyrinthodontoid structure: numerous,
small, concentrically striated scutes, of an irregular
oval shape, accompany the bones and teeth.</p>

<p>The conclusions arrived at by the eminent comparative
anatomists to whose examination the remains in question
were submitted, show that the character of the fossils are
those of Perennibranchiate Batrachians; that, with regard
to the long bones, it is not improbable that the corresponding
bones in the <i>Archegosaurus</i> (<a href="#Page_745">p. 745</a>) and <i>Labyrinthodon</i>
(<a href="#Page_741">p. 741</a>) would present similar correspondences with those
of the existing perennibranchiates; and that, although the
<i>Dendrerpeton</i> cannot be referred to any known form of the
two genera just mentioned, yet there exists strong evidence
of its close affinity with these extinct Batrachians.</p>

<p>The <i>Dendrerpeton Acadianum</i> was probably between two
and three feet in length. A series of minute biconcave
vertebr&aelig; were found with the other remains in the erect
tree, these, however, from their relatively small size, and
from other characteristics, are regarded by Professor Wyman
as having probably belonged to some other associated
reptile.</p>

<p>The Labyrinthodont reptiles have been regarded as characteristic
of the Permian and Triassic epochs, their remains
being found in Germany and England in rocks of that age.
The commencement of the existence of this family of
sauroid-batrachians, however, is of greater antiquity, since
their relics also occur in the formations of the Carboniferous
epoch. The <i>Archegosaurus</i> (<a href="#Page_745">p. 745</a>), a batrachian
but slightly removed from the true Labyrinthodont type,
has left its well-characterized remains in the Coal of Germany;
the <i>Parabatrachus</i>, in that of Scotland; and the
allied <i>Dendrerpeton</i>, in the Nova Scotian coal-field. This
last-mentioned great carboniferous formation has, however,
afforded fossil evidence of the existence of the true Labyrinthodonts
in the Coal-period, for some cranial bones,
imbedded in a mass of Pictou coal, lately sent to England
by Mr. J. W. Dawson, and the subject of a Paper by Professor
Owen, read before the Geological Society, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749"> 749 </a></span>
demonstrated by that distinguished pal&aelig;ontologist to have
close affinity with the corresponding parts of the skull of
the Triassic genera <i>Capitosaurus</i> and <i>Metopias</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ICHNOLITES.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ichnolites</span> (<i>Foot-prints on stone</i>). <a href="#lign_245"><i>Lign.</i> 245</a>.&mdash;The sandstones
and mud-stones of many localities retain the track-prints
of animals that have passed along on the surface of
the beds when in a soft state. These foot-prints, or <i>ichnolites</i>,
either occur as impressions on the surface originally
marked lay the animal in the act of progression, or as the
reverse of such impressions, being casts <i>in relief</i> on the
under side of the layer covering the surface originally
impressed. Such indications of footsteps and trails have
been noticed especially in the forest marble, a member of
the Lower Oolite series, where Crustacea and Mollusks have
left their markings, and in the New Red Sandstone, where
the indications of reptilian quadrupeds and of bird-like
bipeds<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> have been here and there preserved in great distinctness.

by Mr. W. E. Logan, on the very ancient and rippled surfaces
of the Potsdam Sandstone of North America (see <a href="#Page_543">p. 543</a>,

to the Geological Society the discovery of markings, referred
by him to the little entomostracous Hymenocaris (see p.

ichnolites are those discovered by Capt. L. Brickenden<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> in
the Old Red, at Cummingston, near Elgin, which have

<div class="sidenote">RAIN-PRINTS ON STONE.</div>

<p>Imprints are found on the face of each successive stratum;
and on some of the layers, not only the tracks of animals
that have walked over the clay when soft are distinctly
observable, but the surface is often traversed with casts of
the cracks caused by the desiccation of one layer of clay
previously to the deposition of the succeeding layer of sand
or mud; and it often presents a blistered or warty appearance,
being covered with either little hemispherical eminences
or depressions, which an accurate investigation of
the phenomenon has proved to have been produced by
showers of rain (<i>Ly.</i> figs. 526-528). On the slabs of
sandstone, the forms of the sun-cracks, rain-drops, and foot-prints
appear in relief, being casts moulded in the soft

<p>The foot-prints on these strata are of several kinds; some
appear to have been produced by small reptiles and crustaceans;
but the principal imprints are identical with those
which have been observed in Saxony, and are referable to
some large quadruped, in which the fore-feet were of a much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752"> 752 </a></span>
smaller size than the hind-feet (<a href="#lign_245"><i>Lign.</i> 245</a>). From a supposed
resemblance of the imprints to those of a human
hand, Professor Kaup proposed the name of <i>Cheirotherium</i>,
to designate the unknown animal which had left these
"footsteps on the sands of Time." But since Professor
Owen&#8217;s discovery, that the bones and teeth of reptiles found
in similar strata in Warwickshire belong to gigantic Batrachians,
and since the fore and hind-feet of the frog-tribe are
often as dissimilar in size as the impressions of the <i>Cheirotherium</i>,
it has been suggested, with much probability, that
the foot-prints in question may be those of Labyrinthodonts;
but until the form of the feet of these extinct Batrachians
can be ascertained, this inference must be regarded as conjectural
(<i>Ly.</i> <i>fig.</i> 331).</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_753" id="Page_753"> 753 </a></span>
sandstone in Scotland. Of these there are five species at
Corncockle Muir, in Dumfriesshire: they are termed <i>Chelichnus</i>
by Sir W. Jardine, who has lately described them in
his <i>Ichnology of Annandale</i>, a splendid folio work, illustrated
with full-sized lithographs, coloured after nature.
They are accompanied with three other forms of footstep
(<i>Herpetichnus</i>, <i>Batrachnis</i>, and <i>Actibatis</i>), one of which Sir
W. Jardine regards as indicative of an animal probably of
a saurian form.</p>

<p>At Grinsill quarry, from which the remains of the <i>Rhynchosaurus</i>
(p. 712) were obtained, some small foot-prints have
been observed, which, with some probability, have been
referred to that animal (<i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> 1841, p. 146).</p>

<p>A beautifully distinct series of foot-prints, with the mark
of a trailing tail, on a rippled slab from the New Red of
Shrewley Common, Warwickshire, are figured and described
by Strickland and Murchison (<i>Geol. Trans.</i> 2d ser. vol. v. pl.

<p>The fossil <i>Teeth of Reptiles</i> are commonly found in as
perfect a state of preservation as those of fishes; and require
but the usual care for their preservation. But the collector
should assiduously search for vestiges of the jaw and cranium;
and it is desirable to place in the same drawer any
undetermined bones found associated with the teeth; as
they may ultimately afford some clue to the nature of the
original animal. The microscopical examination of the
teeth is to be conducted in the manner previously directed
(p. 639); but for valuable specimens the lapidary should be
employed, and transverse sections made from near the apex,
the middle, and base of the tooth; if due care be taken,
several slices may be obtained from one specimen. I have
ten slices from one tooth of the Labyrinthodon. The bones
imbedded in limestone generally partake of the chemical
character of the rock, and are often permeated with calcareous
spar; mere fragments, when polished, frequently
display the internal structure.</p>

<p>The suggestions for repairing fossil bones (p. 46) render
further instructions on that head unnecessary; and the
description of the development of the specimen of Hyl&aelig;osaurus
(p. 689) affords a practical lesson to the young collector.</p>

<p>When a vertebra is found in an imperfect state, it should
be closely examined on the spot, and, if it present proofs of
recent fracture, the detached processes should be sought for;
even if the body of a vertebra be imbedded in stone, and
the processes appear to have been broken off before it was
enveloped in the rock, the corresponding parts will often be
found in the same mass of stone. There is in the British
Museum a very fine Saurian vertebra imbedded in a large
slab of Tilgate stone, in which the spinous process is seen
lying in the same block, several inches distant from the
centrum or body; when observed in the quarry the latter
only was exposed, and I was about to detach it from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755"> 755 </a></span>
slab, for the convenience of carriage, when I perceived indications
of the spinous process. The vertebra was therefore
allowed to remain, and the stone chiselled away, so as to
expose the spine; and the specimen then displayed its
present interesting character.</p>

<p>It may frequently happen that a fragment of a large
bone,&mdash;as, for example, the thigh-bone of the Iguanodon,&mdash;may
be obtained from a quarry; and after an interval of
some weeks the corresponding portions be discovered. This
was remarkably exemplified in the first specimen which
revealed to me the peculiar characters of the femur of the
Iguanodon. The lower part, or condyloid extremity, of a
gigantic bone, firmly impacted in a block of Tilgate-grit,
was found in a quarry near Cuckfield; it was evidently but
a fragment of the fossil, for the fracture was recent; I therefore
requested the quarry-men to make diligent search for
the corresponding portion, but without success. Several
months afterwards, upon a fresh explosion in the quarry,
the head of a large bone was found loose among the fallen
mass; but there were no indications that it belonged to
the specimen previously found; and it was regarded as
another relic of some one of the colossal animals whose
bones were distributed in the Wealden deposits. Teeth,
fragments of bones, and other fossils were from time to time
obtained from the same quarry; and among these a huge
quadrangular fragment of bone, similar to the enormous
mass that had so long been in my possession, and had defied
all attempts to ascertain its character.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> It was some time
before it occurred to me, that the three portions of unknown
colossal bone might belong to the same specimen; but
eventually they were found to correspond, and upon cementing
them together, the femur of the Iguanodon was, for the
first time, developed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_718" id="Footnote_718"></a><a href="#FNanchor_718"><span class="label">[718]</span></a> The fragment alluded to is figured, <i>Foss. Til. For.</i> pl. xviii.</p></div>

<p>The figures in <a href="#lign_206"><i>Lign.</i> 206</a> will assist the collector in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756"> 756 </a></span>
recognising the different vertebral processes, even when
occurring as detached fragments. When specimens are
evidently rolled or water-worn, there is, of course, no probability
that the corresponding portions will be met with.
Every fragment of a bone the nature of which is not obvious
should be carefully preserved; for sooner or later its characters
may be ascertained. It is scarcely necessary again
to remind the collector, that search should be made for indications
of the soft parts around the bones; the specimen
of the paddle of the Ichthyosaurus (<a href="#lign_215"><i>Lign.</i> 215</a>, p. 669), with
its integument, must have impressed this fact too strongly
on the mind to be soon forgotten. If the impression of the
extremities of a bone, of which a fragment only remains,
be observed, the block of stone should be preserved, as a
cast may be taken, and the entire form of the original be
ascertained.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="caption3">ORNITHOLITES; OR FOSSIL BIRDS.</p>


<p>Excepting in strata of comparatively modern origin,
the remains of Birds are of extreme rarity in a fossil state.
In the caverns that contain the skeletons of carnivorous
animals, and which in many cases were once their dens,
the bones of several species of existing genera of Birds
have been discovered, in England, on the Continent, in
America, and in Australia; and recently there have been
obtained from alluvial deposits in New Zealand the skeletons
of Birds, some of enormous magnitude, and under conditions
which leave some doubt whether, like the <i>Dodo</i>, the
species may not have been extirpated by man during the
last few centuries; or even if some stray individuals of the
race may not, according to the belief of the aborigines, be
still, in existence in the interior of the country.</p>

<p>From the gypsum quarries at Montmartre, near Paris,
Baron Cuvier obtained several species of Ornitholites; and
Prof. Owen has described the relics of three or four species
from the London Clay: these fossil birds of the eocene tertiary
deposits are the most ancient relics of this class known
to the geologist, with the exception of the foot-prints on the
<i>New Red</i> sandstone of North America, that have been
referred to animals of this class.</p>

<p>The rarity of the remains of Birds may probably in some
measure be attributable, as Sir C. Lyell has suggested, to
the peculiar organization of these animals; for their power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760"> 760 </a></span>
of flight necessarily renders them less liable to be engulphed
and imbedded in the deltas of rivers or in the bed of the
ocean, than quadrupeds; and the lightness of their structure,
occasioned by their tubular bones and feathery dermal
integument, generally prevents the sinking of the bodies of
such as die on, or fall into, the water; so that their carcases
are devoured or decomposed.</p>

<p>In illustration of this subject, I purpose, in the <i>first</i> place,
to explain such peculiarities in the osteology of the animals
of this class, as may assist the collector in the identification
of their fossil remains; <i>secondly</i>, to take a cursory survey
of the geological distribution of fossil Birds, and examine
a few of the most interesting examples; and <i>lastly</i>, consider
the striking phenomena presented by the foot-prints of supposed
Birds on the strata of those ancient deposits which
are comprised in the <i>Trias</i> or New Red formation.</p>


<div class="sidenote">OSTEOLOGY OF BIRDS.</div>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Osteological Characters.</span>&mdash;The skull in adult birds
presents this remarkable feature, that it is composed of but
one bone without any trace of suture: the osseous tissue is
very compact; the bone is white, and very smooth externally.
The lower jaw is formed, as in reptiles, of several
bones, namely, articular, angular, supra-angular, and dental;
it is united to the skull by the intervention of a bone (<i>os
quadratum</i>), as in certain reptiles. Both jaws are destitute
of teeth, and are protected by dense horny sheaths, which
form powerful dentary organs. The vertebral column of
the neck is exceedingly flexible, and is composed of a greater
number of bones than in any other living animals; for the
cervical verteb&aelig;, which in the mammalia amount to seven,
in birds vary from ten to twenty-four, as in the Swan. To
admit of this extreme mobility of the neck without injury
to the enclosed spinal cord, the annular part, or neural arch,
of each cervical vertebra is enlarged at the extremities that
form a junction with the corresponding bones; thus presenting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761"> 761 </a></span>
a modification of vertebral development directly the
reverse of that possessed by the extinct saurian of the
Magnesian conglomerate (see p. 714). The dorsal and sacra
vertebral, on the contrary, are firmly interlocked, and often
anchylosed together, and constitute a strong, inflexible
pillar to afford a fixed point of support to the powerful
locomotive organs of flight. There are no <i>lumbar</i>, or rib-less
vertebr&aelig;. The sacrum often consists of eighteen,
twenty, or more vertebr&aelig;, anchylosed into a solid bone.
In the young Ostrich the vertebr&aelig; may be found separate
and distinct; and the neural arch is shifted to the union
of two vertebr&aelig;, as in the <i>Megalosaurus</i>. The sacral spinal
cord is almost as large as the brain; to supply the large
muscles. The foramina for the passage of the nerves are
double, one for the sensitive, and the other for the motive
root, which pass out separately and unite in. a ganglion
externally. The ribs are formed so as to combine strength
with lightness in the construction of the walls of the chest,
for each rib has a <i>recurrent apophysis</i>, or process, that
extends backwards, and glides over the contiguous bone;
this is a very peculiar and obvious character.<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> The ribs are
united in front to the sternum by bony processes, analogous
to the <i>costal-arcs</i> of the Plesiosaurus. The pectoral arch is
distinguished by the prominent longitudinal keel or crest
of the sternum; a structure designed to give attachment to
the powerful pectoral muscles which move the wings, and
which presents characteristic modifications in the different
orders; and by the peculiar bone, termed the <i>furcula</i>, or
merry-thought, which connects the clavicles. The clavicles
are strongest and most open in birds of strongest flight.
The coracoids (in birds) relate to respiration, and serve to
admit of contraction and expansion of the sternum and
abdomen. The bones of the anterior extremities are modified
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762"> 762 </a></span>
to adapt these instruments for the purposes of flight,
and those of the fore-arm (<i>radius</i> and <i>ulna</i>) are very long,
and firmly united together; the ulna has a row of slight
eminences for the attachment of the quills of the secondary
feathers. The wrist, or <i>carpus</i>, is composed of but two
bones, articulated to the radius and ulna, and which admit
only of a <i>lateral</i> movement, by which the wings are folded
close to the body. The bones of the hinder extremities consist
of the thigh or <i>femur</i>;<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> the leg-bones, <i>tibia</i><a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> and <i>fibula</i>,
the latter very small and anchylosed to the former; and of
a single shank-bone, which supplies the place of the tarsal
and metatarsal bones of other animals. This bone is articulated
at its upper extremity to the tibia, and terminates
at the lower end in distinct processes, which correspond in
number with the toes; each process having a groove for the
pulley-like tendon that moves the corresponding toe. This
construction is peculiar to birds; for although in some
quadrupeds, as the horse for example, the metatarsus consists
of but one piece, the tarsus is composed of several
bones.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_719" id="Footnote_719"></a><a href="#FNanchor_719"><span class="label">[719]</span></a> In very old crocodiles an analogous apophysis, which is generally
cartilaginous, is sometimes found, ossified (<i>Owen</i>).</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_720" id="Footnote_720"></a><a href="#FNanchor_720"><span class="label">[720]</span></a> The acetabulum, or socket for the head of the thigh-bone, is
always perforated. The femur has a surface for the articulation
of the fibula; and by this character the femur of all birds may be
distinguished. There is always a <i>patella</i>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_721" id="Footnote_721"></a><a href="#FNanchor_721"><span class="label">[721]</span></a> The lower end of the tibia is very like that of the femur.</p></div>

<p>The toes of birds present deviations equally recognisable;
for the number of the articulations (or <i>phalangeal</i> pieces of
bone) in each toe is different. Thus the thumb, or short
toe, has <i>two</i> bones; the first toe on the inner side <i>three</i>; the
the middle toe <i>four</i>; and the outer toe <i>five</i>. In general,
three toes are directed forwards, and one backwards. In
some species, the thumb or opposable toe is altogether
wanting; in others, as in the swallow, it is directed forwards;
in climbing birds, both the outer and the back toe
are situated behind. The position of the hind toe, therefore,

affords an important indication of the habits of the
bird (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 146, <i>Lign.</i> 23), and from a fragment of
the lower extremity of the shank or tarso-metatarsal bone,
with any trace of this articulation, we may determine
whether the individual to which it belonged was a climber,
wader, &amp;c. In the toes of Crocodiles alone, the number of
joints is the same as in birds; but in these reptiles, each
toe is supported by a distinct metatarsal bone. The osteological
peculiarities above enumerated may assist the collector
in arriving at some general inferences as to the nature
of any fossil remains of birds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dinornis</span> (<i>fearfully great bird</i>). <i>Pict. Atlas</i>, frontispiece,
and p. 172&mdash;Numerous bones of large extinct birds have
been obtained in New Zealand by Mr. Rule, the Rev. W.
Williams, Col. Wakefield, Mr. Walter Mantell, and others.
These have been referred by Professor Owen to tridactylous
struthious birds (one of which was one-third larger than
the African ostrich), resembling the living <i>Apteryx</i> of New
Zealand (<i>Wond.</i> p. 128, <i>Petrif.</i> p. 106) in the proportions
of the tibia to the metatarsus, and also in the rudimental
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764"> 764 </a></span>
state of the wings. The bones are found in the recent
alluvium, but probably in some cases at least they have
been washed by the streams from older alluvial deposits.</p>

<p>An account of the history of the discovery of the gigantic
Moa&#8217;s bones in New Zealand (<i>Wond.</i> p. 129) is given in
full in <i>Petrif.</i> p. 93, <i>et seq.</i>; and the scientific description
of the various parts of the skeleton of the <span class="smcap">Dinornis</span> and
<span class="smcap">Palapteryx</span>, chiefly collected from Professor Owen&#8217;s elaborate
and finely illustrated memoirs in the Transactions of
the Zoological Society, should be consulted, <i>Petrif.</i> p.
108, &amp;c. Of <i>Dinornis</i> Professor Owen discriminates seven
or eight species; of <i>Palapteryx</i>, three species; and indications
of a species of a third associated genus, <span class="smcap">Aptornis</span>.</p>

<p>Fragments of egg-shell accompany these interesting relics
of birds from New Zealand. From Madagascar also bird-bones
and eggs have been obtained in a fossil state, that
indicate the original bird (<i>&AElig;pyornis</i>) to have been even of
a greater size than the Dinornis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ornitholites of the Caverns.</span>&mdash;Many limestone districts
abound in fissures and caves, which vary in extent
from more superficial hollows to deep excavations and
caverns of considerable magnitude (<i>Wond.</i> p. 175, &amp;c.)
Beneath the stalagmitic or sparry floors of some of these
caverns, the bones of extinct species of Cats, Bears, and
Hy&aelig;nas, occur in immense quantities; but the full consideration
of these phenomena will be reserved for the next
chapter. The skeletons and detached bones of several
kinds of Birds are often found imbedded with these remains;
and under circumstances which seem to indicate that they
were brought into these caverns as prey by the carnivora,
with whose relics they are now associated. Some examples
show that the birds had fallen into the fissure; others, that
their bones had been transported to their present situation
by the action of water.</p>

<p>In the Cave of Kirkdale, in Yorkshire (<i>Wond.</i> p. 179),
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765"> 765 </a></span>
Dr. Buckland found bones of the Raven, Lark, Pigeon,
Duck, and others; and as almost all the specimens were
the remains of wing-bones, it is considered probable that
they are the relics of dead birds, which had been brought
into the cave by the hy&aelig;nas, whose den it is supposed to have
been for a considerable period (<i>Reliqui&aelig; Diluvian&aelig;</i>, p. 34).</p>

<p>Similar remains have been discovered in the Kent&#8217;s Hole
cavern, and in that at Berry Head, Torbay; from the
latter Professor Owen has obtained the wing-bones of a
Falcon (<i>Brit. Fos. Mam. and Birds</i>, p. 558).</p>

<p>In France, the Lunel-Viel caverns have yielded a few
bird-bones; and many such remains occur in the caves of
Brazil, described by M. Lund.</p>

<p>The so-called "bone-breccia" of the coasts and islands
of the Mediterranean (<i>Wond.</i> p. 185) contains frequent
remains of birds: they have been especially noticed at
Cette, Nice, Sardinia, and Gibraltar.</p>


<p>In the deposits especially referred to the northern drift
or Boulder-clay period, fossil birds appear to be very rare,
although the remains of vertebrate terrestrial animals are
locally abundant. Dr. Buckland states that some bones,
apparently of a species of goose, found at Lawford, with
the remains of Hy&aelig;na, Elephant, Rhinoceros, &amp;c., is the
only instance he has met with of fossil birds in the drift of
England (<i>Reliq. Diluv.</i> p. 27).</p>

<p>On the Continent, bird-bones have been found, at
Quedlingbourg, Meissen, and in the Lahn Valley, in deposits
said to be of this age.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ornitholites of the older Tertiary Deposits.</span> (<i>Lign.</i>
246.)&mdash;The very rich pliocene deposits at &#338;ningen (p. 559)
have afforded a few fragments of birds&#8217; bones.</p>

<p>Three or four species of Ornitholites (Duck, Heron,
Flamingo, &amp;c.), and several examples of the eggs of birds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766"> 766 </a></span>
have been discovered in the lacustrine strata of Auvergne.
Birds&#8217; bones also occur in the fresh-water limestone near
Issoire, in the Buy de D&ocirc;me, associated with the remains of
eocene mammalia. In Germany, bird-bones have been found
in tertiary deposits at Wiesbaden, Wiesnau, and Mornbach.
In the Siwalik Hills the remains of birds are associated with
the fossil reptilia and mammalia, to which reference has
already been made (p. 731).</p>

<p>From the quarries of gypseous limestone of Montmartre,
near Paris, Baron Cuvier obtained many bones, and some
connected portions of the skeletons of several birds related
to the Pelican, Sea-lark, Curlew, Woodcock, Owl, Buzzard,
and Quail.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> In several of these examples there are the
imprints and remains of the quills and feathers; in some
the skeleton has perished, and a pellicle of dark-brown
substance, with the configuration of the original, alone
remains (see <a href="#lign_246"><i>Lign.</i> 246</a>). These Ornitholites are associated
with the bones of the Pal&aelig;otheria, and other extinct mammalia
of the eocene period. Two or three Ornitholites have
been discovered at Montmartre, in which almost the entire
skeleton is preserved. In one example, described by Cuvier,
the remains of a bird are displayed in such a manner as to
render it probable that the animal had fallen on its belly,
and become partially impacted in the surface of the soft
gypsum, which is now become solid stone; and that, previously
to its being completely enveloped, the principal
part of its head and the left leg were removed either by
some voracious animal, or by the action of the water. In
addition to the other parts of the skeleton, the under side of
the bill is very distinctly impressed on the stone, and the
left branch is entire; there are also the remains of the
cellular basis of the skull; and both the wings are well
preserved. Nine or ten species of fossil birds were identified
by Cuvier from the Paris eocene strata.</p>

bones, obtained from the London Clay of the Isle of
Sheppey. These relics present a close agreement with the

smaller species of Vulture than any now known to exist.</p>

<p>In his "History of British Fossil Mammalia and Birds,"
1846, Professor Owen has also described another sacrum
from the Sheppey Clay, a <i>sternum</i> from Primrose Hill, and
the <i>cranium</i> of a bird, probably of the <i>Halcyonid&aelig;</i> family,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768"> 768 </a></span>
from the same eocene deposit at Sheppey. This has also

the characters belonging to bird&#8217;s bone, the result of this

eminent microscopists, Mr. Bowerbank and Professor Quekett, may
be enabled before long to elucidate the intimate structure of pterodactylian
bone; which, although of an essentially reptilian type, has
characters of its own, offering some resemblances to bird-structure,
that have not yet been fully described. Some specimens of bones
from the Wealden (for instance, the specimen figured in <i>Geol. Trans.</i>

exhibit under the microscope an intimate structure resembling that
seen in bird-bone, in contradistinction to that characteristic of reptilian
bone. But until we are better acquainted with the microscopic structure
of the osseous tissue of the Pterosaurians, and are in possession
of more perfect specimens of bones, it cannot be satisfactorily determined
to what extent the class of Birds existed in the country of the
Iguanodon.</p></div>

of the class of birds, as evidenced by the foregoing pages, is
carried back but to a comparatively recent era in the
earth&#8217;s history: and indeed, in the present state of our
knowledge, it may be said that all positive evidence of the
former existence of this highly organized class of vertebrated
animals is confined to the Tertiary and Wealden
deposits. A most interesting discovery, however, by Dr.
James Deane,<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> of Greenfield, U. S. seems to prove that
numerous bird-like bipeds, and some of gigantic size, existed
at the period when the Triassic or <i>New Red</i> strata were
in the progress of formation; that period, as the reader
will remember, in which the Labyrinthodonts and other
extraordinary reptiles flourished. <i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> 1841,
p. 230, note.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_726" id="Footnote_726"></a><a href="#FNanchor_726"><span class="label">[726]</span></a> See "Illustrations of Fossil Foot-prints of the Valley of the
Connecticut," 1849, 4to. with nine plates.</p></div>

<p>In certain localities of the New Red sandstone in the
valley of the Connecticut, numerous tridactyle markings had
been occasionally observed on the surfaces of the slabs of
stone when split asunder, in like manner as the ripple-marks
appear on the successive layers of sandstone in Corncockle
Muir, Tilgate Forest, &amp;c. Some remarkable distinct impressions
of this kind at Turner&#8217;s Falls (Massachusetts)
happening to attract the attention of Dr. Deane, that sagacious
observer was struck with their resemblance to the
foot-marks left on the mud-banks of the adjacent river by
the aquatic birds which had recently frequented the spot.
The conviction that the imprints on the stone were referable
to a similar origin with those on the mud was so
strongly impressed on his mind, that he immediately collected
a series of specimens, and communicated his discovery
and opinion to Professor E. Hitchcock, who followed up
the inquiry with a zeal and success that have led to the
most interesting results. No reasonable doubt now exists
that the imprints in question have been produced by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770"> 770 </a></span>
tracks of bipeds, impressed on the stone when in a soft
state. The announcement of this extraordinary phenomenon
was first made by Professor Hitchcock, in the American
Journal of Science (January, 1836); and that eminent
geologist has subsequently published full descriptions of the
different species of imprints which he has detected, with
excellent lithographs, in his "Geology of Massachusetts."
(See <i>Petrif.</i> pp. 64-73.)</p>

<p>Three highly interesting specimens of the Ornithoidichnites
of North America, collected and developed by Dr.
James Deane, have been lately added to the collection of
organic remains in the British Museum. They exhibit
several varieties of the foot-prints, and are in a very fine
state of preservation. The surface of the largest slab is
eight feet by six, and bears upwards of seventy distinct
impressions, disposed in several tracks, as shown in the

are rendered more distinct by the lines drawn from

<p>The enormous size of some of the foot-marks is calculated
to excite great surprise. I have in my possession (through
the kindness of Dr. Deane) imprints that prove the size of
the foot to have been fifteen inches in length, and ten inches
in width, exclusive of the hind claw, which is present
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772"> 772 </a></span>
in some species, and is here two inches long. The foot-prints
of this biped when in a consecutive series of five
or six, are from four to six feet apart; which, of course,
must have been the length of the stride; the longest stride
was probably made by the animal when running; the
shortest, when walking at a moderate pace. These footsteps
indicate proportions so far exceeding those of all
known living bipeds,&mdash;for the foot of the African ostrich is
but ten inches long,&mdash;that the geologist may be pardoned
for having hesitated to adopt the opinions of the American
savans, in the absence of any relics of the osseous structure
of the supposed birds; although sanctioned by the high
authority of Dr. Buckland, who, from the first, concurred in
the views of Professor Hitchcock (<i>Bd.</i> ii. p. 39): but this
objection has been in a great measure removed by the discovery
of the remains of the gigantic Moa or Dinornis of
New Zealand, with feet equal in magnitude to the largest of
the Connecticut foot-prints. See p. 763, and <i>Pict. Atlas</i>,
frontispiece. Professor Hitchcock is of opinion that upwards
of forty species of these biped foot-prints may be distinguished.
Foot-prints referable to chelonians, batrachians,
and lizards are associated with the above.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">On Collecting the Fossil Remains of Birds.</span>&mdash;Notwithstanding
the extreme rarity of fossils of this class, the
student should not be discouraged in his search for the
remains of Birds in the secondary rocks. That far more
instructive specimens than any that have fallen under my
observation may be discovered in the Wealden strata by
diligent research, there can be no reasonable doubt. It is
also very probable that the Stonesfield slate, which abounds
in remains of terrestrial plants and animals, will be found to
contain Ornitholites. It is important for the collector to
bear in mind, that when only a fragment of the shaft of
a bone remains imbedded in the stone, if the imprint of the
other portions be preserved, he may obtain a knowledge of
the form of the extremities; in the same manner as the
external markings of the surface of a shell may be ascertained,
when the shell itself is lost or destroyed, and a
smooth stony cast of the internal cavity only is left. The
same remark will apply to the bones of reptiles and other
animals; for example, a perfect leg-bone may be imbedded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774"> 774 </a></span>
in a block of limestone; but, when exposed by breaking
the stone, a portion of the shaft may alone remain attached,
and both extremities be shattered to pieces by the concussion
of the blow; yet, if the impression remains, the entire form
of the original may be determined.</p>

<p>The <i>foot-prints</i>, not only of birds, but of reptiles and other
animals, should be diligently sought for on the surfaces of
laminated strata of sand and clay, and especially where the
presence of ripple-marks, and the impressions of rain-drops,
indicate that the beds were deposited in shallow water. The
forest-marble flags at Castle Comb, north of Bath, the Stonesfield
slates, and the sandstones around Horsham (in Sussex),
and particularly at Stammerham (see <i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 213),
are often rippled, and it is therefore probable that the
foot-prints of some of the Oolitic and Wealden quadrupeds
and bipeds, if such existed, will sooner or later be discovered.</p>

<p class="caption3">FOSSIL MAMMALIA.</p>


<p>The remains of <span class="smcap">Mammalia</span> discovered in a fossil state
include an immense number of species, and furnish examples
of almost every living genus, and of numerous genera, and
even orders, of which no existing species are known. Yet
amidst the vast accumulations of the skeletons of the higher
orders of vertebrata contained in the tertiary deposits, and
in the superficial drift, belonging to species which have
successively appeared on the surface of our planet, flourished
for indefinite periods of time, and then become annihilated,
no vestiges of <span class="smcap">Man</span>, or of his works, have been detected.
Human skeletons, naturally imbedded, have hitherto only
been observed in the silt of modern alluvial plains,<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> in
peat-bogs (<i>Wond.</i> p. 64), and in conglomerates of recent
date, such as are in the progress of formation on the sea-shores,
particularly where the water is loaded with the
detritus of shells and corals, and the waves transport the
calcareous matter along the margins of creeks and bays, or
deposit it in the shallows along the coast (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 87,
and <i>Petrif.</i> p. 483).</p>

not dwell upon the subject in the present volumes. Neither
is it desirable to enter at large upon this department of
Pal&aelig;ontology, for it were vain to attempt the elucidation of
the anatomical characters of but one extinct species of Mammalia,
without giving details of structure, that could only be
successfully demonstrated in a work expressly devoted to the
subject. Referring, therefore, to Cuvier&#8217;s <i>Ossemens Fossiles</i>,
and to Professor Owen&#8217;s "<i>History of the British Fossil Mammalia</i>,"
8vo. 1846, I must limit my remarks on the Fossil
Mammalia to a brief summary of modern discoveries, with
suggestions for the identification and collection of some of
the most interesting or prevalent remains.</p>

termed fishes, are as perfect air-breathing vertebrated
animals, as the terrestrial mammalia, and, like them, give
suck to their young. Instead of fore-feet or arms, they have
a pair of fins or paddles, but are destitute of hinder extremities,
the place of the latter organs being supplied by
a powerful cartilaginous horizontal fin, appended to the tail.
The Cetaceans, therefore, differ in this respect from the fossil
marine reptiles, the Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus (see
p. 662), which have two pairs of paddles. This order, as is
well known, comprises the most colossal forms of animal
existence,&mdash;the Whales. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous;
many have powerful teeth; others are edentulous,
the jaw being furnished with a series of elongate plates of
the substance familiarly known by the name of <i>whale-bone</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Brighton Fossil Whale.</span>&mdash;An interesting discovery of
the anterior half of one side of the lower jaw of a Whale,
undoubtedly coeval with the extinct Mammoth (<i>Elephas
primigenius</i>), was made in 1828 in the Cliff, east of Kemp
Town, Brighton, under the following circumstances. On
the face of the Cliff, in the ancient shingle which lies immediately
upon the chalk and is surmounted by beds of
calcareous rubble, containing bones and teeth of Elephants,
to the height of one hundred and twenty feet, some fishermen
had observed a huge bone, that had been laid bare by
an unusually high tide and now projected two or three feet
beyond the face of the Cliff. Unable to remove it, they
broke off the extremity, a fragment of which was sent to me.
Upon repairing to the spot a few days afterwards, I found
that the fishermen had renewed their attack, and demolished
a considerable portion of the bone in ineffectual attempts to
dislodge it from its bed; and had desisted only from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779"> 779 </a></span>
apprehension of being buried beneath the overhanging cliff,
which is composed of loosely aggregated materials. Unfortunately,
the bone extended directly into the cliff, and it
required several hours of labour, not unattended with danger,
before an excavation was made sufficiently large to expose
the entire specimen. It proved to be the anterior nine feet
of the left branch of the lower jaw of a whale-bone Whale
(<i>Bal&aelig;na mysticetus</i>). It was of a light fawn colour externally,
but the internal coarse osseous structure was delicately
white; it was extremely brittle, and, upon attempting to
move it, broke into a thousand pieces. Time would not
permit of the application of a coating of plaster of Paris, for
ere we had completed our task the tide was rapidly approaching,
or this interesting relic might have been extracted entire.
This portion of lower jaw, before it was mutilated by the
fishermen, was twelve feet long, and thirty-six inches in circumference
at the largest extremity. It must have belonged
to a Whale from sixty to seventy feet in length.<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_736" id="Footnote_736"></a><a href="#FNanchor_736"><span class="label">[736]</span></a> The fragments of this jaw that were preserved are now exhibited

<p>In the fluviatile silt of the valley of the Ouse, near
Lewes (<i>Wond.</i> p. 63), the skull of a Porpoise and a portion
of the cranium, with the socket of the long straight tooth,
of a Narwhal (<i>Monodon monoceros</i>), were found twelve feet
beneath the surface of the soil.</p>

<p>The bones of an herbivorous Cetacean, the <i>Manatus</i>, a
genus now peculiar to the torrid zone, have been found in
the eocene strata in various parts of France, associated with
those of the Pal&aelig;otheria and other extinct mammalia of the
Paris basin.</p>

very remarkable Cetacean, of an extinct genus, were first
made known by Dr. Harlan, of Philadelphia, who obtained
a considerable portion of the jaws with teeth, vertebr&aelig;, and
other bones of an animal of enormous size, from Alabama
and Arkansas, United States. These relics were discovered
in tertiary (<i>eocene</i>) limestone, associated with a marine
shelly conglomerate, from a cliff near the bed of the river
Owachita. When first observed, the bones extended along
the face of the rock, with intervals between them, to the
extent of one hundred feet, and the animal to which they
belonged must have exceeded seventy feet in length.
Dr. Harlan ascribed these bones to an unknown reptile,
which he called Basilosaurus (<i>king of the lizards</i>); but a
more correct investigation, by Professor Owen, proved their
cetacean character, and the peculiar form of the worn molar
teeth suggested the name of <i>Zeuglodon</i> (<i>yoke-tooth</i>).</p>

<p>The teeth (<a href="#lign_250"><i>Lign.</i> 250</a>) are of two kinds, some having but

transverse section, <a href="#lign_249"><i>Lign.</i> 249</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2. They are devoid of
enamel, but the dentine is coated with cement, and their
structure is decidedly mammalian; and a microscopical
examination, Professor Owen states, incontestably proves
their cetacean character. The longitudinal diameter of the
middle tooth is three inches.</p>

numerous in the alluvial deposits, in caves, and in pleistocene
deposits, in almost every part of the world. They are
generally associated with the remains of the next group.
The skulls of Oxen, and horns and bones of the Bison and
Auroch, have been found in North Cliff, Yorkshire, at
Walton in Essex, and other parts of England. The fossil
oxen appear to have been one-third larger than the recent
species; and the horns are relatively more massive than in
the domestic race; some of the horns measure four feet
across, at the widest expansion. In the immense accumulations
of large mammalia in the tertiary beds of the Sub-Himalayan
or Siwalik range, numerous remains of oxen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783"> 783 </a></span>
occur. The teeth of one species are often found in the

<p>Of the Deer family the relics of several kinds have been

alone contained the remains of three species.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> The bones
of a species that cannot be distinguished from the common
Bed Deer are found in the modern shell-marls of Scotland,
associated with the remains of oxen, horse, boar, dog, wolf,
and beaver. The bones and antlers of the Reindeer have
been found at Brentford and other places (<i>Brit. Foss. Mam.</i>
p. 479; and <i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> 1851. Sect. p. 69). The ossiferous
caverns, which contain bones of Carnivora, also yield
those of Deer; as the caves of Kirkdale and Banwell, &amp;c.
in England, and the celebrated caverns of Muggendorf, on
the Continent. A species of Musk-deer has been found at
Epplesheim; and bones of deer are associated with those
of the Dinotherium, in Rhenish Hesse, in late Tertiary
deposits. The teeth and a lower jaw, with other bones, of
a species of deer, were obtained from the Brighton Elephant
bed (<i>Wond.</i> p. 114).</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Giraffe</span>, the tallest of known quadrupeds, and now
restricted to the deserts of Africa, was once a native of
Europe and Asia, for fossil bones of a species of this remarkable
ruminant have been found at Issoudun, in France,
and in the Siwalik mountains, with several varieties of Elk
and Deer.</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Camel</span>, the only ruminant with incisor teeth in
the upper jaw, a gigantic species has been discovered by
Dr. Falconer and Captain Cautley, in the Siwalik range.</p>

<p>In this category we must notice another most interesting
discovery of the indefatigable and eminent naturalists above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785"> 785 </a></span>
mentioned, namely, the <i>Sivatherium</i> (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 163), an
extinct animal, which forms, as it were, a link between the
ruminants and the large pachydermata. The skull has
four persistent horns, and was furnished with a nasal proboscis.
The living creature must have resembled an immense
Antelope or Gnu, with a short thick head and an
elevated cranium, crested
with two pairs of horns.
A splendid specimen of
the skull of the <i>Sivatherium</i>
has been placed in
the pal&aelig;ontological collection
of the British Museum
by Dr. Falconer

<p>The fossil bones and teeth (<i>Pict. Atlas</i>, pl. lxxi. lxxiv.) of
these gigantic animals are so abundant, that examples may
be found in all the provincial, and in most private collections;
and the British Museum possesses an unrivalled
series of specimens of both groups of these colossal herbivorous
mammalia, namely, the Elephants properly so called
and the Mastodons (<i>Petrif.</i> pp. 463, 471). It contains an
invaluable series of specimens from the Siwalik hills, presented
by Capt. Cautley and Dr. Falconer (<i>Petrif.</i> p. 469);
amongst which are remains in which the dental organs
present every modification of structure, from that of the
mastoid tubercles of the tooth of the Mastodon, to the vertical
lamin&aelig; of cement, enamel, and dentine of the Elephant.
The Museum also possesses the entire skeleton of the Mastodon
(<i>Petrif.</i> <a href="#lign_107"><i>Lign.</i> 107</a>) formerly exhibited by M. Koch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787"> 787 </a></span>
as well as the fine suite of jaws and teeth obtained by the
same indefatigable collector. This collection demonstrates
that all the bones and teeth, apparently of several species,
and, as some have supposed, of distinct genera, belong but
to the one grand Mastodon&mdash;the <i>M. giganteus</i> of Cuvier; it
also clearly proves that the young mastodon had a pair of
tusks placed horizontally in the lower jaw; and that but
one of these tusks became developed in the adult, and that
only in the male.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a></p>

<p>It is therefore unnecessary to enlarge upon this subject,
for an inspection of a few specimens will afford the student
a clearer insight into the structure of the skeletons and
teeth of these animals than any description. The form of
the teeth, and the disposition of the dental elements, are

Darmstadt, in beds of sand and marl of the median Tertiary
formations, the jaws, teeth, skull, and other remains of the
Dinothere, one of the most gigantic of terrestrial mammalians,
have been discovered; they are preserved in the museum at
Darmstadt. The length of the largest species is estimated
at eighteen feet. The teeth had previously been found in
France, Bavaria, and Austria; and, from their close analogy
to those of the Tapir, were described by Cuvier as belonging
to an extinct colossal animal of that genus. But subsequent
discoveries have shown that the <i>Dinotherium</i> was
probably a proboscideal animal, and had two large curved
tusks directed downwards in the anterior extremity of the
lower jaw.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

large proportion of the numerous bones and teeth which
are found in the Tertiary gypseous deposits at Montmartre,
near Paris, are referable to the several extinct genera of
Pachydermata, which the genius of Cuvier first made
known. The <i>Pal&aelig;otheria</i> and <i>Anoplotheria</i> must be familiar
to the intelligent reader, for the restored outlines of
several species are appended to almost every work that
treats of the ancient inhabitants of our globe. The details
of their anatomical characters are given at length in <i>Oss.
Foss.</i> tom. iii., illustrated with numerous plates.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;otheria</span> (<i>Brit. Foss. Mam.</i> p. 316, <i>et seq.</i>) resembled
the Tapirs in their head and short proboscis, while
their molar teeth approached those of the Rhinoceros, and
their feet were divided into three toes, instead of four, as
in the Tapirs. Upwards of eleven species have been discovered,
varying from the size of the Rhinoceros to that of
the Hog. Their remains are extensively diffused in the
Upper Eocene strata in various parts of France; and have
been found in the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Lophiodon</span> (<i>crested-tooth</i>), a genus distinguished from
the former by the characters of the teeth, which more nearly
resemble those of the Tapirs, comprehends twelve species,
all found in the fresh-water Tertiary marls of France. A
canine tooth of a species of <i>Lophiodon</i> was found in the
London Clay, in sinking a well on Sydenham Common,
near the railway.<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Anoplotheria</span> have two characters not observed in

<p>There are also sub-genera, as for example, <i>Xiphodon</i> and

structure; and <i>Anthracotherium</i> (so named from
two species having been found in a bed of Anthracite or

animals are imbedded with the remains of carnivora, marsupialia,
bats, birds, crocodiles, tortoises, and fishes.</p>

<p>In England, no remains of the extinct Pachydermata of
the Paris Tertiary strata were discovered until a few years
since, and they are still exceedingly rare. There have been
found in the fresh-water limestone at Binstead, near Ryde,
and at Seafield, Isle of Wight, (see <i>Geol. I. Wight</i>, 1854,
Prefat. Note,) teeth and portions of the jaws of two species
of Anoplotherium, four of Pal&aelig;otherium, and one of <i>Ch&aelig;ropotamus</i>,
an animal allied to the Hog Tribe (<i>Geol. Trans.</i>

<p>The <i>Hyopotamus</i> (<a href="#lign_257"><i>Lign.</i> 257</a>) is a genus of Anthracotherioid
pachyderms, two species of which have been determined
by Prof. Owen (<i>Quart. Geol. Journ.</i> vol. iv. p. 103,
&amp;c.), from specimens of teeth found in the upper eocene of
the north-west coast of the Isle of Wight, by the Marchioness
of Hastings.</p>

<p>The <i>Pal&aelig;otherium</i>, <i>Dichobune</i>, <i>Dichodon</i>, <i>Paloplotherium</i>,
and others occur in the upper eocene fresh-water deposits
of Hordwell Cliff (see <i>Charlesworth&#8217;s Journal</i>, No. 1, p. 5,
and pl. ii.; <i>Quart. Geol. Journ.</i> vol. iv. p. 17, and pl. iii.;
and <i>Rep. Brit. Assoc.</i> 1851, <i>sect.</i> p. 67).</p>

<p>Two species of a new genus, intermediate between the
Hog and the Hyrax, named by Professor Owen <i>Hyracotherium</i>,
have been discovered in the eocene sands at Kyson,
in Suffolk, and in the London Clay of the cliffs at Studd
Hill, about a mile to the west of Herne Bay.<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> The latter

very extensively distributed in alluvial debris, in the ossiferous
breccia of caverns, and in other pleistocene deposits;
and their remains are frequently dug up in the superficial
marls, clays, gravel, and sand of England. As the teeth of
these animals will occasionally be met with by the collector,
a brief explanation of their form and structure may be
useful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth of Mammalia.</span><a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>&mdash;The organization of the teeth in
the herbivorous mammalia essentially consists in the adaptation
of the three elements of dental structure to the peculiar
conditions required by the habits and economy of the
different species. Thus, in the Elephant (<a href="#lign_259"><i>Lign.</i> 259</a>, 260),
Horse (<a href="#lign_263"><i>Lign.</i> 263</a>), &amp;c., the dentine, cement, and enamel are
disposed in vertical plates more or less inflected, the enamel
and cement penetrating the body of the tooth, and embracing
corresponding processes of dentine; an arrangement
by which a grinding surface, composed of three substances
of unequal densities, is produced and maintained in every
state of detrition (<i>Owen</i>). But these teeth do not possess
the symmetrical and complicated structure observable in
those of many of the reptiles and fishes we have previously
investigated. In the carnivorous mammalia, the enamel
constitutes an external shell or case, investing the body of
dentine and presenting sharp cusps or trenchant ridges,
adapted for the laceration of flesh, as in the Tiger, or modified
so as to form instruments for snapping and crushing
bones, as in the teeth of the Hy&aelig;na. In the Mastodon, the
crown of the tooth, when first emerged from the gum, presents
a series of strong conical eminences (<a href="#lign_254"><i>Lign.</i> 254</a>), that
become worn down by use, at first into disks (<i>Ly.</i> p. 157),
which, by further detrition, coalesce. The tooth of the
Elephant (<a href="#lign_259"><i>Lign.</i> 259 and 260</a>), on the contrary, consists of
vertical plates of dentine, with an immediate investment of
enamel, over which there is an external layer of cement that
binds together the entire series of plates, often amounting
to twenty or more; the horizontal surface produced by the
detrition of such a structure, gives rise to the well-known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794"> 794 </a></span>
grinding surface of the molars of the elephant (<a href="#lign_259"><i>Lign.</i> 259</a>,
260; <i>Wond.</i> pp. 143 and 160; <i>Ly.</i> p. 159; Owens <i>Brit.
Foss. Mam.</i> figs. 88-90, &amp;c.). Detached plates of the teeth
of Elephants, particularly of those which belong to the back
part of the posterior grinder, and have not come into use,
are puzzling to the inexperienced collector of fossil remains;
and the first indication I obtained of the existence of the
remains of fossil Elephants in Brighton Cliffs (<i>Wond.</i> p. 150),
was from a mass of this kind, dug up in sinking a well in
Dorset Gardens, and sent to me as a "petrified cauliflower."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mylodon.</span><a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>&mdash;By this name is designated a gigantic edentate
animal, allied to the Sloth, and formerly described as a
species of Megalonyx, an almost perfect skeleton of which
has been obtained from a fluviatile deposit, a few leagues to
the north of the city of Buenos Ayres, and is now articulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_801" id="Page_801"> 801 </a></span>
and exhibited in the Museum of the Royal College of
Surgeons of England.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> The animal appears to have been
imbedded entire, and soon after its death, for the parts of
the skeleton were found but little displaced, and the very
few bones that are wanting, are such as might easily have
escaped the search of the collector. But this magnificent
specimen of the extinct fauna of South America must be
seen to be properly appreciated. The skeleton measures
eleven feet from the fore part of the skull to the extremity
of the tail, the latter being three feet in length; the circumference
of the trunk around the tenth pair of ribs is
nine feet nine inches; the Megatherium is eighteen feet in
length, and its girth fourteen and a half feet. These particulars
will serve to convey an idea of the relative size of
these gigantic animals. From certain peculiarities in the
construction of the skeleton of the Mylodon, Prof. Owen,
perceiving from the teeth that it was a vegetable feeder,
and probably lived on leaves and the tender buds of trees,
and its enormous bulk and weight forbidding the assumption
that it climbed up trees and suspended itself by the
branches, like the diminutive existing Sloths,&mdash;assigns to
this creature the task of uprooting and felling trees, and
feeding upon the foliage of the forests it laid prostrate. A
remarkable development of the substance of the bones of
the skull is presumed to hare been a provision against the
fatal effects of a fracture of the cranium, to which the
Mylodon, from its supposed uprooting propensities, is conjectured
to have been peculiarly exposed; and the skull
of the specimen in the College bears proofs of having had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_802" id="Page_802"> 802 </a></span>
two fractures, from both of which the animal recovered.
But whoever looks at the skeleton will perceive that the
fore-feet are admirably adapted for seizing and wrenching
oft the branches, and the hinder feet for clasping the
trunk of a large tree; and there is nothing to forbid the
supposition, that the animal could obtain a constant and
ready supply of food, by climbing up the stem to a sufficient
height, and wrenching off the branches. Prof. Owen
states, that the Mylodon unites the two great groups of the
<i>Unguiculata</i> (animals with nails and claws), and the <i>Ungulata</i>
(hoofed animals), for it has both hoofs and claws on the
same feet.</p>

<p>The dental organs consist of four molars on each side the
lower, and five on each side the upper jaw. The teeth are
implanted in very deep sockets, and are of the same size
and form throughout, with a conical pulp-cavity at the
base, indicating that their growth continued during the life
of the animal. In structure they resemble those of the
Megatherium and Sloth (<i>Bradypus</i>); being composed of a
pillar of coarse dentine, traversed by numerous vascular or
medullary canals, which is invested with a layer of very fine,
dense dentine, with minute calcigerous tubes, and the
whole surrounded by a thick coating of cementum: no
enamel enters into their composition. (<i>Owen.</i>)</p>

<p>A species of Didelphys (<i>Opossum</i>) has been discovered in
the gypseous limestone of Montmartre, and is figured and
described by Cuvier (<i>Oss. Foss.</i> vol. iii. pl. lxxi.; see also
<i>Brit. Foss. Mam.</i> p. 76). It consists of a considerable part
of the skeleton of a small animal, imbedded in gypsum;
the block containing the specimen has been split asunder,
and some of the bones are attached to the surface of one
moiety, and the remainder to the other. From the character
of the jaws and teeth, Cuvier pronounced that the
animal was related to the Opossum, and confidently predicted
that the two peculiar bones which support the pouch
in these animals would be found attached to the fore-part
of the pelvis; accordingly he chiselled away the stone, and
disclosed these <i>marsupial</i> bones; thus proving the truth of
those laws of correlation of structure, which he was the first
to enunciate and establish. But as there are true marsupials
in which the <i>ossa marsupialia</i> are merely rudimentary, for
example, in the Dog-headed Opossum, or "Hy&aelig;na" of the
Tasmanian colonists (<i>Thylacinus Harrisii</i>), in which they
are merely two small, oblong, flattened fibro-cartilages,
imbedded in the internal pillars of the abdominal rings, and
are only six lines long and three or four lines broad,&mdash;it
follows that in a fossil state the pelvis of a true marsupial
animal may be destitute of those appendages which are
commonly supposed to be an essential character of the
marsupial skeleton. Thus the fossil pelvis of the Thylacinus,
had that species been long ago, as it is soon likely to
be, extinct, would not have afforded the certain evidence
of its marsupial character to which Cuvier triumphantly
appealed in demonstration of the Didelphys of the gypsum
quarries of Montmartre; yet the Thylacinus would not
therefore have been less essentially a marsupial animal.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a></p>

<p>These most important organic remains have all been found
in the oolitic calcareous flag-stones of Stonesfield: deposits
which, as we have already had occasion to notice, teem with
other relics of great interest. Two specimens of the natural
size are represented <a href="#lign_265"><i>Lign.</i> 265</a>, and will serve for reference
to the collector who may visit that interesting locality.</p>

<p>The existence of undoubted mammalia in the secondary
formations was first made known by Dr. Buckland (in
1823), who, upon the authority of Cuvier, stated that the
two specimens then discovered at Stonesfield belonged to
marsupials allied to the Opossum (<i>Didelphys</i>). These fossils
were the left branches of two lower jaws; both were imbedded
in the stone by the external surface, the inner side
only being exposed. One of the specimens has ten molar
teeth in a row; the other (the beautiful fossil, <i>fig.</i> 1, <i>Lign.</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_807" id="Page_807"> 807 </a></span>
265, now in the British Museum,) has seven molars, one
canine tooth, and three incisors. Five other specimens
have since been found.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_762" id="Footnote_762"></a><a href="#FNanchor_762"><span class="label">[762]</span></a> See <i>Brit. Foss. Mam.</i> pp. 15-70, for ample details of their anatomical
characters, and physiological relations.</p></div>

<p>The <i>Amphitherium</i> had thirty-two teeth in the lower jaw,
that is, sixteen on each side; it is presumed to have been
insectivorous, and to have belonged to the <i>placental</i> mammalia.
The <i>Phascolotherium</i> had four true molar teeth,
and three or four false molars, one canine, and three
incisors in each branch of the lower jaw; and closely
approximates to <i>marsupial</i> genera now restricted to New
South Wales and Van Diemen&#8217;s Land. It is, indeed, as
Professor Phillips first remarked, an interesting fact, that
the other organic remains of the British Oolite correspond
with the existing forms now confined to the Australian
continent and neighbouring seas; for in those distant
latitudes, the <i>Cestracionts</i>, <i>Trigoni&aelig;</i>, and <i>Terebratul&aelig;</i> inhabit
the ocean, and the <i>Cycade&aelig;</i> and <i>Araucari&aelig;</i> flourish
on the dry land (<i>Wond.</i> p. 894).</p>

<p>Thus we have evidence of the existence of the Marsupial
order during the Secondary and Tertiary formations, a
proof, as Dr. Buckland observes (<i>Bd.</i> p. 73), that this order,
instead of being, as was once supposed, of more recent introduction
than other orders of mammalia, was, in reality, the
most ancient condition under which animals of this class
first existed in the earlier geological epochs, and was coexistent
with many other orders throughout Europe in the
Eocene period; while its geographical distribution in the
existing fauna is restricted to North and South America,
and to New Holland, and the adjacent islands.</p>


<p><span class="smcap"><a id="VII_Fossil_Carnivora"></a>VII. Fossil Carnivora.</span>&mdash;The fossil bones and teeth of
numerous species of <i>Carnivora</i>, the order comprising the
mammalia which prey on other animals, of which the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_808" id="Page_808"> 808 </a></span>
Weasel, Bear, Cat, Dog, &amp;c. are examples, abound in fissures
and caverns, in conglomerated rocks, and in drifted sand
and gravel. The remains of the colossal Pachyderms, the
Mastodons and Elephants, lie buried, for the most part, as
we have previously shown, in the superficial alluvial deposits;
but the Carnivora, although occasionally entombed with
the Herbivora in superficial gravels and loams, are principally
found imbedded in the floors of extensive caverns.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a>
In many instances, such immense quantities of bones and
teeth of individuals of all ages, and belonging to but one
or two species, occur in certain caves, as to render it probable
that these were for a long period the dens of the
extinct species of Bears, Hy&aelig;nas, &amp;c. whose bones they
enclose.</p>

caves of the Brazils, see <i>Petrif.</i> p. 483.</p></div>

<p>Another remarkable geological condition in which fossil
bones of Carnivora occur, is that of an ossiferous conglomerate,
or <i>bone-breccia</i>; that is, a conglomerate formed of
fragments of limestone and bones, cemented together into a
hard rock by a reddish calcareous concretion. This breccia
is found in almost all the islands on the shores of the basin
of the Mediterranean Sea; as for example, at Gibraltar,
Cette, Nice, Cerigo, Corsica, Palermo, &amp;c. The most celebrated
of the bone-caves are situated in Franconia, and in
many parts of the Hartz. That of Gailenreuth has long
been known for its fossil treasures, which principally consist
of the bones and teeth of two extinct species of Bears. One
of these is equal in size to a large horse, and is termed <i>Ursus
spel&aelig;us</i> (Bear of the Caverns); and skeletons have been
found of all ages, from the adult to the cub but a few days
old (see <i>Wond.</i> pp. 176, 177). There are numerous caverns
in the neighbouring district, some of which are equally
rich in the remains of Carnivora.<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Similar fossils are also
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_809" id="Page_809"> 809 </a></span>
found in the consolidated gravel and drift in various parts
of Germany, and in the fissures of rocks containing iron-ore,
at Kropp, in Carniola.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_764" id="Footnote_764"></a><a href="#FNanchor_764"><span class="label">[764]</span></a> A highly interesting account of the Ossiferous Caves of the

<div class="sidenote">BONE-CAVERNS.</div>

<p>Even in Australia, caves with ossiferous breccia are
numerous; but the bones belong to extinct marsupial
animals of genera still existing in the country (see <i>Rep. Brit.
Assoc.</i> 1844; <i>Petrif.</i> p. 133; and <i>Wond.</i> p. 188). In England,
several caverns presenting similar phenomena have
been discovered. That of Kirkdale, near Kirby Moorside,
Yorkshire, is well known from the celebrity it acquired by
the graphic illustration of its contents by Dr. Buckland.<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
This cave, or rather fissure, for its dimensions were too
limited to merit the name of cavern, was situated in oolitic
limestone; it was two hundred and fifty feet long, from
two to fourteen high, and six or seven wide. The floor was
occupied by a bed of indurated mud, covered over with a
thick crust of stalagmite; the roof and sides being invested
with a similar calcareous sparry coating, as is commonly the
case in all fissures in limestone rocks.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> From this cave
were obtained numerous bones of Hy&aelig;nas, associated with
bones, more or less fractured, of Tiger, Bear, Wolf, Fox,
Weasel, Elephant, Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Horse, Deer,
Ox, Hare or Rabbit, Mouse, Water-rat, and fragments of
skeletons of Ravens, Pigeons, Larks, and Ducks. Many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_810" id="Page_810"> 810 </a></span>
bones exhibited marks of having been gnawed, and crushed
by the teeth of some animals. From all the facts observed,
and which are detailed by Dr. Buckland with his wonted
graphic power, it is inferred that the cave was inhabited for
a considerable period by Hy&aelig;nas; that many of the remains
found there were of individuals carried in and devoured by
those animals, and that in some instances the hy&aelig;nas
preyed upon each other. The portions of bone referable to
the elephant seem to prove that occasionally the large
mammalia were also obtained for food; but it is probable
that the smaller animals were either drifted in by currents
of water, or fell into the chasm through fissures now closed
up by stalactitical incrustations.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_765" id="Footnote_765"></a><a href="#FNanchor_765"><span class="label">[765]</span></a> Dr. Buckland&#8217;s celebrated work, "Reliqui&aelig; Diluvian&aelig;," contains
an admirable description of these caverns and their contents, with
numerous plates. The student, in consulting this volume, must
separate the <i>facts</i> from the diluvial theory, which, at the period of
its publication (1823), they were supposed by Dr. Buckland and other
eminent geologists to confirm.</p>

<p>Kent&#8217;s Cave, near Torquay, Oreston Cave, near Plymouth,
and several other caves in Devonshire, have yielded great
numbers of bones and teeth of Carnivora and Pachydermata
(see <i>Reliq. Diluv.</i> p. 67).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kent&#8217;s Hole</span> is the most productive ossiferous cavern in
England, and its vicinity to Torquay renders it of easy
access. An extensive collection of teeth and bones was
obtained from this cave by the late Rev. J. MacEnery, comprising,
in addition to the usual extinct Carnivora, skulls
and teeth of Badger (<i>Meles taxus</i>), Otter (<i>Lutra vulgaris</i>),
Pole-cat (<i>Putorius vulgaris</i>), Stoat or Ermine (<i>P. erminius</i>),
&amp;c. A selection of the choicest specimens in this collection
is deposited in the British Museum.</p>

<p>In Glamorganshire, two large caverns, called Goat&#8217;s Hole,
and Paviland Cave, containing numerous bones of Bear,
Hy&aelig;na, Wolf, Fox, Rhinoceros, Elephant, &amp;c., are situated
in a lofty cliff of limestone, between Oxwich Bay and the
Worm&#8217;s Head, on the property of Earl Talbot, fifteen miles
west of Swansea (<i>Reliq. Diluv.</i> p. 82).</p>

<p>In the western district of the Mendip Hills, in Somersetshire,
there are several ossiferous fissures and caves. The
most interesting are those of Hutton, on the northern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_811" id="Page_811"> 811 </a></span>
escarpment of Bleadon Hill; and of Banwell, lying about a
mile to the east of Hutton. They contain remains of two
species of bear, one (<i>Ursus spel&aelig;us</i>) of immense size and
strength; and of Tiger, Hy&aelig;na, Wolf, Fox, Deer, Ox, and
Elephant.<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a></p>

<p>From the caves at Hutton, the Rev. D. Williams obtained
the milk-teeth and other remains of a calf-elephant, about
two years old, and those of a young tiger, just shedding its
milk-teeth; also the grinders of a young horse, that were
casting their coronary surfaces; and remains of two species
of hy&aelig;na.</p>

<p>But one instance of the fossil bones of Carnivora has been
observed in the south-east of England. It occurred in a
fissure in a quarry of sandstone at Boughton, near Maidstone;
among other bones, the lower jaw of a Hy&aelig;na (see
Frontispiece of Vol. I.), with the teeth, was obtained.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a></p>

<p>In the modern silt of our alluvial districts, the remains of
carnivorous animals, formerly indigenous to this island, are
occasionally met with; and the skeleton of the Brown Bear
(a species which inhabited Scotland eight centuries ago),
and of the Wolf, whose extinction is of a yet later date, have
been discovered. The Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge
contains an entire skull of the Brown Bear (<i>Ursus arctos</i>),
found in the Manea Fen of Cambridgeshire;<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> in an ancient

<p>Although we cannot dwell on foreign localities of Carnivora,
I may mention that the lacustrine pliocene formation
of &#338;ningen occasionally yields fine remains. A splendid
specimen, obtained from that locality by Sir R. I. Murchison,
displays almost the entire skeleton of a Fox-like animal, the
<i>Galecynus &#338;ningensis</i> of Prof. Owen.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Seal</span>, which is one of the marine carnivorous mammalia,
also occurs in a fossil state in England. A femur of
a species of <i>Phoca</i> has been found, with the remains of a
Monkey and Bat, in a tertiary deposit in Suffolk. In the
tertiary strata of Malta an extinct species of Seal has also
been discovered. In the bone-beds of New Zealand my son
frequently found bones and teeth of Seals, probably of the
species now inhabiting the South Pacific. (<i>Petrif.</i> p. 130.)</p>

<p>Of the <span class="smcap">Insectivora</span>, the fossil remains of several genera
occur. In England, the jaw with teeth of a large species of
Mole (named <span class="smcap">Pal&aelig;ospalax</span>,<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> <i>ancient mole</i>), has been discovered
in a lacustrine deposit at Ostend, near Bacton, on the
coast of Norfolk, associated with bones of Elephant, Deer,
Roebuck, and Beaver. This animal must have been as large
as a hedgehog. The only part of the skeleton hitherto obtained
is a portion of the left side of the lower jaw, containing
six molars; its natural affinities have therefore been inferred
from the characters of the crowns of the teeth.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Cheiroptera</span> (<i>hand-wings</i>) or <span class="smcap">Bats</span>, are mammalia
which have the power of flight, from the bones of the
phalanges or fingers being enormously elongated and giving
support to a fine membranous expansion; they are rarely
found fossil, although, from their habits of haunting and
hybernating in fissures and caves, their skeletons often
occur mingled in the earth of the floor of caverns, and
imbedded in crannies of rocks, with bones of extinct animals.</p>

which they were imbedded; and almost at the same time in
France and in the Sub-Himalayas; and very recently in the
Brazils and in England. The first European specimen was
discovered at Sansan, near Auch, about forty miles west of
Toulouse, by M. Lartet, with remains of the Rhinoceros,
Deer, Antelope, Pal&aelig;otherium, &amp;c. It consists of the lower
jaw, almost complete, with all the teeth, of an adult animal,
of an extinct species, related to the long-limbed and tailed
monkey, called <i>Semnopithecus</i>, of which the Negro Monkey
is an example. A fragment of another jaw has been found
in the same locality.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Monkey of the Sub-Himalayas.</span>&mdash;In the inexhaustible
mine of fossil bones, discovered by British
Officers in India, the upper jaw of an Ape was found by
Messrs. Baker and Durand, and fragments of other jaws and
some bones were subsequently collected by Dr. Falconer
and Captain Cautley. These relics conjointly established
the existence of a gigantic quadrumanous animal in the
groves of India at the Eocene epoch, when the gigantic Tortoise,
the lofty Sivatherium, and the colossal Mastodon
tenanted the plains, and Hippopotami frequented the marshes
and rivers. This fossil Ape also is related to the <i>Semnopithecus</i>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Fossil Monkey of South America.</span>&mdash;Dr. Lund, the
eminent Danish naturalist, to whose indefatigable researches,
and successful determination of the colossal Edentata, we
have previously alluded, has discovered the bones of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815"> 815 </a></span>
gigantic Ape, four feet in height, related to the Capuchin
Monkey, in the ossiferous breccia of the caves of Brazil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">British Fossil Monkeys</span>, <i>Ly.</i> p. 202.&mdash;The first fossil
relic of a quadrumanous animal from the British strata was
obtained in 1839, from a bed of Eocene sand, at Kyson,
a few miles east of Woodbridge, in Suffolk, by W. Colchester,
Esq. The first specimen found consisted of a small
fragment of the right side of the lower jaw, with the last
molar tooth entire in its socket; another relic is the crown
of one fang of the first molar tooth, of the same species.
These relics have been referred to an extinct species of
Monkey, related to the <i>Macacus</i>, which has been named
<i>Macacus eoc&aelig;nus</i>, in allusion to the geological age of the
stratum in which the remains were discovered.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> In this
Eocene sand have also been discovered the remains of a Bat
(p. 813), and of a Marsupial (<i>Didelphys</i>, p. 805), and numerous
fish-teeth (<i>Lamna</i>, p. 594); whilst in the clay overlying
this sand were found the vertebra of a Serpent (<i>Pal&aelig;ophis</i>,
p. 738) and several teeth of a Pachyderm (<i>Hyracotherium</i>,
p. 791). Prof. Owen in the <i>Hist. Brit. Foss. Mam.</i>
p. xlvi. figures and briefly notices the relics of another species
of <i>Macacus</i>, from the newer pliocene, or pleistocene, brick
earth at Grays, Essex.</p>

<p>The search for fossils of this class is attended with much

In the following list, page 818, the localities most likely to
be productive are enumerated; but we have no caverns, as
in Germany, so rich in remains of this kind as to ensure
the discovery of specimens by the casual visitor; for the
treasures of the most productive cave, that of Banwell, are
prohibited; the proprietor carefully preserving every fragment.
A short residence near some of the best localities and
daily research are required for obtaining interesting specimens.
For example, a residence at Ryde, for a search in the
fresh-water tertiary limestone at Binstead; at Torquay, for
Kent&#8217;s cavern; or some other town or village near the other
caves in Devonshire; Herne Bay, for the London Clay at
Studd&#8217;s Hill, that produced the Hyracotherium; Woodbridge
or Kyson, for the Suffolk mammalia; Walton and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_817" id="Page_817"> 817 </a></span>
Clacton, in Essex, for remains of Elephants in the pleistocene
deposits of that coast.</p>

<p>In searching for bones and teeth in an unexplored cave,
the following suggestions by Dr. Buckland will be found of
great value. Select the lowest parts in the cavern or fissure
into which any mud or clay can have been drifted or accumulated;
and then break through the stalagmitic crust of
the floor, and dig down into the silt and pebbles, &amp;c. below,
in which bones and teeth will be found, if the spot contains
any relics of this kind. As a test for distinguishing the
ancient bones found in these caves from those which may
have been recently introduced, the tongue should be applied
to them when dry, and they will adhere in consequence of
the loss of their animal gluten, without the substitution of
any mineral substance, such as we commonly find in the
fossil bones of the regular strata. Human bones found in
caves always possess too much animal gluten to adhere to
the tongue when dry.<a name="FNanchor_779" id="FNanchor_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a></p>

<p>Along the eastern coast of England, and often off the
mouth of the Thames, the fishermen dredge up teeth, tusks,
and bones of Elephants; and good specimens may sometimes
be thus procured. The Ramsgate fishermen employed
in trawling in the North Sea and English channel, frequently
bring up in their gear fragments of fossil bones of Mammoths,
and other mammalia. From the bank of the Goodwin-sands,
large tusks have been procured. On the shore near
Herne Bay, very fine mammalian remains are occasionally
obtained. In the Museum at Canterbury, there was (and I
believe is) a good collection of fossil bones of large Pachydermata
procured from the neighbouring coast. It is a
remarkable fact, that immense quantities of the bones of
Mammoths, or fossil Elephants, are strewn over the bed of
the German Ocean and English Channel.<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> The late Mr.

<p class="caption3">BONE CAVES IN FRANCONIA.</p>

<p class="smaller">&#8258; Captain Willoughby Montagu having favoured me in 1844 with an account
of the state of the principal caves in Franconian Switzerland, which he
had lately visited, the subjoined extract may be useful to the continental
traveller. The cave of <i>Sophienh&ouml;hle</i> appears to be highly interesting; the
stalactites remaining uninjured, and the ossiferous floor in the state in which
it was discovered; whilst the much-frequented caverns have been stripped
of every relic by the spoliations of visitors during the last century and a
half.</p>

<p class="smaller">"The northern part of Bavaria, which is denominated 'Franconian
Switzerland,' is situated about the centre of a triangle, formed between
Bamberg on the N.W., Bayreuth N.E., and Nuremberg S.; the best
road from this latter city diverging beyond Erlangen to the north.</p>

<p class="smaller">"The nearest route from London is through Belgium, from Ostend
or Antwerp, by the line of railroad which (since October, 1843) passes
on from Liege and Verviers, by Aix-la-Chapelle to Cologne. Thence
by steam up the Rhine, by Coblentz to Mayence, and again by railway
to Frankfort. In summer there are steam boats up and down the
Maine, as far as Wurzburg, daily, and higher up, between Schweinfurt
and Bamberg, which latter distance is performed in eight hours going
up. and five down. Or there is a diligence (<i>eilwagen</i>) from Frankfort
direct to Nuremberg, from which place (or Bamberg, &amp;c.) a carriage
must be hired to Muggendorf, the principal village of that interesting
district. It lies about half way on the post road between Erlangen
and Bayreuth, and has two tolerable country inns; the people are
civil, and moderate in their charges, at least for the freshest trout and
good wine of Bavaria.</p>

<p class="smaller">"This charming spot and neighbourhood attracts not only the geologist
and lover of the picturesque, but also the angler, who finds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_821" id="Page_821"> 821 </a></span>
excellent fishing in the clear, rapidly-winding streams of the Wiesent,
with its tributary waters, all of which are romantically placed in the
suddenly deep dales of this table-land. The Wiesent flows through
Forchheim into the Regnitz, westward, and this into the Maine,
north.</p>

<p class="smaller">"As to the time necessary to get there, during the summer days it
would only require one to pass through Belgium to Aix, including the
transit of this frontier into Prussia, with slight search of baggage.
Then, in between four and five hours to Cologne, where the steamers
generally wait for the arrival of these trains; and, taking the first
boat up, it is possible to reach Bingen (if not Mayence late) the same
evening. From Frankfort, by diligence, starting at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, and travelling
all night, Nuremberg may be reached on the second day; and the
centre of operations, about Muggendorf, on the fifth from quitting the
sea-coast. In returning by the Maine,&mdash;from Wurzburg to Mayence
maybe performed in one long day, and then on the Rhine, the descent
being much quicker than the upward course against the streams, the
return homewards may be accomplished in one day less.</p>

<p class="smaller">"The nearest way to Ostend is by the South-Eastern Railroad to
Dover, and embark for Belgium.</p>

<p class="smaller">"The newly-discovered cave, called <i>Sophienh&ouml;hle</i>, lies on the right
bank of a streamlet, which gives its name to a romantic and rocky
valley, <i>Ahorn-thal</i>, and flows S.W. toward G&ouml;sweinstein, until it falls
into the Wiesent. The situation of the cave is near Klaustemerh&ouml;hle,
and opposite to Ludwigsh&ouml;hle: and it is far easier of access than
Gailenreuth, and may be inspected by ladies with the greatest facility.
An intelligent female showed us through its lofty and interesting
details. This cave is nearly 300 feet wide, and 150 feet in height.
The quantity of fossil bones strewed about the floor was very great,
notwithstanding many of the finest specimens had been removed, and
were to be seen in the neighbouring castle of Count S&mdash;&mdash;; added to
this, the long, pendant curtains of stalactite, and the stupendous size
of the cavern, contributed to make it appear to me far surpassing in
interest that near Gailenreuth, called <i>Zoolithen-H&ouml;hle</i>, which I had
visited the day before. The keys of this cavern&mdash;for this, as well as
the other celebrated caves, is locked up, to guard against depredations&mdash;are
kept at the large farm or steward&#8217;s house, hard by. The state of
the weather prevented our visiting Forstersh&ouml;hle (<i>Forest Cavern</i>),
which lies further N.E. beyond the little town of Weischenfeld, near
Zeubach; but which, we were informed, was equal in interest to this
of Sophienh&ouml;hle. The tourist desirous of visiting this interesting district,
will find Mr. Murray&#8217;s Handbook of Southern Germany an excellent
guide: I can vouch for its accuracy."</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the close of this argument; we

of Cuvier reveal!</p>

<p>If we endeavour to trace the order of succession, in which
the extinct and existing types of animal and vegetable
organization have appeared upon the face of our globe, as
demonstrated by fossil remains, we at once perceive how
imperfectly our knowledge enables us to present a true
picture of the development of organic life as it existed in
the remotest ages. Ascending from the <i>Granite</i>&mdash;that
shroud which conceals for ever from human ken the earliest
scenes of the earth&#8217;s physical drama&mdash;the first glimpses we
obtain of animated nature are a few sea-weeds, shells, and
Crustacea. But can we doubt for a moment that that
ancient sea had its boundaries and its shores&mdash;that then, as
now, there were islands and continents, and hills and
valleys, and streams and rivers, teeming with appropriate
inhabitants? The little Lycopodiaceous seed-vessels in the
Ludlow bone-bed afford as certain indication of dry land, as
the olive branch which the dove brought back to the Ark;
one fact of this kind overthrows a host of theories based
upon negative evidence.</p>

<p>Throughout the lower pal&aelig;ozoic rocks organic life presents
numerous modifications; and the remains of small
placoid fishes appear in the uppermost Silurian. In the
Devonian we meet with rare reptilian remains and foot-prints.
In the Carboniferous rocks the sauroid Batrachians
have left their relics and their foot-tracks. In the succeeding
period these reptiles predominate; and on the
sands of the Triassic ocean we have the foot-prints of
monster reptiles and the tracks of bipeds&mdash;colossal bird-footed
creatures&mdash;of which no other vestiges remain, and to
which the existing order of creation affords no parallel.</p>

<p>The last bed of the Trias affords the first indication of
Mammalian life.</p>

<p>We now enter upon that marvellous epoch, during which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_824" id="Page_824"> 824 </a></span>

<p>were the principal inhabitants of vast islands and continents.
But here, as at an earlier period, we have proof
that warm-blooded animals existed; and the diminutive
marsupial insectivorous Mammalia of the Oolite and the
birds of the Wealden attest that the system of animal
creation was complete.</p>

<p>Leaving behind us the Age of Reptiles, we approach that
of the colossal Mammalia, when extensive countries were
peopled by the enormous herbivorous Megatheres, the
Mastodons, and gigantic Pachyderms, long since become
extinct. But with these lost forms many existing races
were contemporary; including the Monkey tribes, which,
of all animals, approach nearest to man in their physical
organization. Thus, by slow and almost insensible gradations,
we arrive at the present state of animate and inanimate
nature. But even after the existing continents had attained
their present configuration, in the period immediately antecedent
to the human epoch, innumerable tribes of carnivorous
animals swarmed throughout the temperate climates
of Europe; the Tiger, Hy&aelig;na, and Bear prowled through
the woods and inhabited the caverns; and the Horse and
Elephant, with gigantic Deer and Oxen, tenanted the plains.</p>

<p>But of <span class="smcap">Man</span> and of his works not a vestige appears
throughout the vast periods embraced in this review. Yet
were any of the existing islands or continents to be engulphed
in the depths of the ocean, and loaded with marine detritus,
and in future ages be elevated above the waters, covered
with consolidated mud and sand, how different would be the

<p>I now propose to conduct the reader to a few British
localities, and point out the mode of examining geological
phenomena in the field, and of collecting organic remains
from the rocks and strata; in other words, afford a practical
illustration of the advantages to be derived from the
knowledge acquired by our previous investigations. But
from want of space, only one or two excursions can be
described in detail; and I must restrict myself in a great
measure to extracts from my note-book, and explanatory
remarks and suggestions for the guidance of the student
and collector. The subjects will be arranged in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Instructions for collecting specimens.</p>

<p>2. Excursions illustrative of the geological character and organic
remains of the Tertiary deposits of the London and Hampshire
basins; namely, to the Isle of Sheppey, Bracklesham Bay, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Notes for a geological Excursion over the Chalk and Wealden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_830" id="Page_830"> 830 </a></span>
districts of the South-east of England; from London, by Tilgate
Forest, to Brighton. Also, from Brighton to Rottingdean.</p>

<p>4. Geological notes of various places on the line of the Great
Western Railway, from London to Clifton.</p>

<p>5. Excursion to Matlock and its vicinity; to examine the nature
and position of the mountain limestone and associated strata of that
part of Derbyshire.</p>

<p>6. Geological Notes for an examination of the central group of the
plutonic or igneous rocks of England, and of the Carboniferous and
Slate strata through which they are protruded: in an Excursion to
Charnwood Forest, by Leicester, Mount Sorel, Swithland, Woodhouse,
&amp;c. to Whitwick.</p>

<p>Before we proceed on a geological excursion, it is necessary
to be provided with suitable instruments to detach
specimens from the rocks, and extract fossils from the
strata in which we may find them imbedded, and with
materials for packing up our treasures, and noting their
localities on the spot. For this purpose, the following
articles will be found more or less requisite, according to
the particular object of the collector:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. A hammer of one of the forms figured in <a href="#lign_266"><i>Lign.</i> 266</a>.
Fig. 3 will be found most generally useful.</p>

<p>2. A leather or strong camlet bag, and one or two of
smaller size; the former with strings, or with a strap for
the shoulder. If travelling in a carriage, a box or basket
may also be provided.</p>

<p>3. Stout and thin paper, and some of a soft kind, for
wrapping up specimens.</p>

<p>4. Chip boxes, and raw cotton, wadding, or tow, for the
same purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_832" id="Page_832"> 832 </a></span></p>

for collecting specimens, for the use of the party
employed under Captain King to survey the Western coast
of Australia; by permission of the author, they are here
subjoined.<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_784" id="Footnote_784"></a><a href="#FNanchor_784"><span class="label">[784]</span></a> For the collection of rock specimens, and for the mode of
observing the phenomena of physical geology, Sir H. De la Beche s
instructive volume, "<i>How to Observe</i>," should be consulted.</p></div>


<p class="caption3">INSTRUCTIONS FOR COLLECTING GEOLOGICAL SPECIMENS.</p>

<p class="smaller">"It may be proper to premise, that two of the principal objects
of geological inquiry are, to determine&mdash;1st, the nature of the
<i>materials</i> of which the earth is composed: and, 2dly, the relative
<i>order</i> in which these materials are disposed in relation to each other.</p>

<p class="smaller">"1. Specimens of rocks ought not, in general, to be taken from
loose pieces, but from large masses in their native place, or which
have recently fallen from their natural situation.</p>

<p class="smaller">"2. The specimens should consist of the stone unchanged by
exposure to the elements, which sometimes alter the characters to a
considerable depth from the surface. Petrifactions, however, are
often best distinguishable in masses somewhat decomposed; and are
thus even rendered visible in many cases where no trace of any
organized body can be discerned in the recent fracture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_834" id="Page_834"> 834 </a></span></p>

<p class="smaller">"3. The specimens ought not to be very small;&mdash;about three
inches square, and three quarters of an inch in thickness, is a convenient
size.</p>

<p class="smaller">"4. seldom happens that large masses, even of the same kind of
rock, are uniform throughout any considerable space; so that the
general character is ascertained by geologists, who examine rocks in
their native places, from the average of an extensive surface. A collection
ought, therefore, to embrace specimens of the most characteristic
varieties; and <i>the most splendid examples are, in general, not
the most instructive</i>. Where several specimens are taken from the
same place, a series of numbers should be added to the note of their
locality.</p>

<p class="smaller">"5. One of the most advantageous situations for obtaining specimens
and examining the relations of rocks is in the sections afforded
by cliffs on the sea-shore; especially after recent falls of large masses,
t commonly happens that the beds thus exposed are more or less
inclined; and in this case, if any of them be inaccessible at a particular
point, the decline of the strata will frequently enable the
collector to supply himself with the required specimens, within a
short distance.</p>

<p class="smaller">"6. To examine the <i>interior</i> of an unknown country, more skill
and practice are required; the rocks being generally concealed by
the soil, accumulations of sand, gravel, &amp;c., and by the vegetation
of the surface. But the strata are commonly disclosed in the sides
of ravines,&mdash;in the beds of rivers and mountain-streams; and these,
especially where they cross the direction of the strata, may be
found, by careful examination, to afford instructive sections.</p>

<p class="smaller">"The mud and gravel in the beds of rivers and in deltas often
contain grains of <i>gold</i>, <i>platina</i>, and other native metals, rubies,
sapphires, and other precious stones; and a general knowledge of the
rocks of an unexplored country often may be gained from the
detritus at the embouchure of a river.</p>

<p class="smaller">"7. Among the contents of the strata, the remains of organized
bodies,&mdash;shells, corals and other zoophytes,&mdash;the bones and teeth of
animals,&mdash;wood, and the impressions of vegetable stems, roots, or
leaves, &amp;c. are of the greatest importance; affording generally the
most marked characters of the beds in which they occur. These
should, therefore, be particularly sought after, and their relative
abundance or rarity in different situations noticed. The fossils
should, if possible, be kept united with portions of the rock or
matrix in which they are found; and where they are numerous,&mdash;in
sand, clay, or any moist or friable matrix,&mdash;it is, in general, better to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_835" id="Page_835"> 835 </a></span>
retain a large portion of the whole mass, to be examined afterwards,
than to attempt their separation at the time of collecting.</p>

<p class="smaller">"8. The <i>loose substances</i> which are found above the solid rocks, in
the form of gravel, silt, rolled pebbles, &amp;c., should be carefully distinguished
from the <i>solid strata</i> upon which they rest. And the more
ancient of these water-worn materials, found on the sides or summits
of hills, &amp;c., should be distinguished from the recent mud, sand, and
gravel, brought down by land-floods or by rivers. The bones and
teeth of quadrupeds are not unfrequently found in the more ancient
gravel; and the collection of these remains from distant quarters of
the globe is an object of the greatest interest to geology.</p>

<p class="smaller">"9. Besides a note of the locality, there ought, if possible, to
accompany every specimen a short notice of its geological circumstances;
as, for example, whether it be found in large shapeless
masses, or in strata? If in strata,&mdash;what are the thickness, inclination
to the horizon, and direction with respect to the compass, of the
beds? If these cannot be measured, an estimate should always be
recorded while the objects are in view. Are they uniform in dip and
direction?&mdash;curved, or contorted?&mdash;continuous, or interrupted by
fissures or veins? Is the whole cliff, or mass of strata in sight, of
uniform composition?&mdash;or does it consist of different kinds of stone?
If the strata be different, what is the order in which they are placed
above each other successively?</p>

<p class="smaller">"10. A <i>label</i>, distinctly written, should accompany every specimen,
stating its native place, its relative situation, &amp;c., and these
labels should be attached to the specimens immediately, on the spot
where they were found. This injunction may appear to be superfluous;
but so much valuable information has been lost to geology
from the neglect of it, that every observer of experience will acknowledge
its necessity. It is useful to mark on the labels the day, and
even the hour, when each specimen is collected. This, with a corresponding
note in the memorandum-book, prevents confusion, and
will be found to assist the memory.</p>

<p class="smaller">"11. A <i>sketch</i> of a coast or cliff, however slight, frequently conveys
more information respecting the disposition and relations of
rocks, than a long memorandum. If numbers, denoting the situation
of the specimens collected, be marked upon such sketches, much
time may be saved at the moment of collecting. But in all such
cases, the memorandum should be looked over soon afterwards, and
labels, distinctly explaining their situation, &amp;c. be attached to the
specimens.</p>

<p class="smaller">"12. The specimens should be so packed, that the surfaces may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_836" id="Page_836"> 836 </a></span>
be defended from exposure to air, moisture, and friction: for which
purpose, if strong paper cannot be obtained, dry moss, or straw, or
leaves may be employed. Where paper is used for wrapping the
specimens, they are best secured by fastening the envelope with
sealing-wax.</p>

<p class="smaller">"Lastly. The collector must not be discouraged, nor be prevented
from collecting, by finding that the place which he may chance to
visit in a remote situation has not a stinking appearance, or the rocks
within his view a very interesting character; <i>since it frequently, and
even commonly happens, that facts and specimens, in themselves of very
little importance, become valuable by subsequent comparison; so that
scarcely any observation, if recorded with accuracy, will be thrown
away</i>."</p>

<p>These general instructions will suffice to prepare the
reader for an excursion to some known locality, where his
researches will certainly be rewarded by many interesting
organic remains; and he may be so fortunate as to meet
with some rare fossils, and perhaps with one or two that
have not previously been discovered; for there is always a
chance of finding relics hitherto unknown, even in a cliff or
quarry that is daily visited by collectors. And as an old
sportsman desirous of inspiring a novice with a love of
field sports, takes him at first to preserves where game is
plentiful, in like manner I would initiate my reader in the
delightful pursuit of collecting <i>Medals of Creation</i>, by conducting
him to a spot where these antiquities of nature are
scattered about in great profusion and variety.</p>

<p class="caption3">EXCURSIONS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE GEOLOGICAL CHARACTERS AND
ORGANIC REMAINS OF THE TERTIARY DEPOSITS OF THE LONDON
BASIN.</p>


<p>In leaving London for any part of England, the reader will
remember that the area on which the metropolis is situated,
as well as the surrounding district to a distance varying
from a radius of ten to twenty or thirty miles, consists of
the marine Tertiary <i>eocene</i> strata (see p. 24), which have
been deposited in, and still occupy, a depression, or excavation
of the Chalk, called the <i>London Basin</i> (<i>Wond.</i> p. 229).
Around this formation, the Chalk forms a distinct boundary
on the south, west, and north, rising up into chains of hills
or downs; but on the east the range is broken, and the
Tertiary basin lies open to the sea, affording a passage for
the Thames and its tributary streams. From this geological
character of the metropolitan district, it results, that all
the lines of railroad proceeding from London traverse, for
the first ten or twenty miles, beds of clay, loam, and
loosely aggregated sand and gravel; hence the numerous
slips that have taken place in the embankments; as for
example, at New Cross, Wandsworth Common, near Hanwell,
&amp;c.; and in all these lines it is obvious, from the
nature of the strata and the steepness of many of the
cuttings, that similar catastrophes will again occur.</p>

<p>The next geological feature observable in the lines of all
the London railroads is the <span class="smcap">Chalk</span>, which is invariably
passed either by steep cuttings, or tunnels, or both; as for

example, from near Croydon to Merstham, by the South-Eastern;
from near Basingstoke to beyond Winchester, by
the South-Western; from Maidenhead to beyond Wallingford,
by the Great Western; and from beyond Watford to
near Ivinghoe, by the Birmingham line.</p>

<p>After passing through the Chalk, and over the marls
and sandstone strata of the Cretaceous formation, the
Oolitic group (consisting of Portland stone, Kimmeridge
clay, &amp;c.), the Lias, New Red or Triassic, and Carboniferous
deposits successively appear on the lines of railroad; excepting
on those of the South-Eastern, which, upon leaving
the Chalk-formation, traverse the fluviatile beds of the
Wealden, as we shall hereafter more particularly describe.</p>


<p class="caption3">EXCURSION TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY.</p>

<p>Every one knows that Sheppey is a small island about
ten miles in length, lying at the mouth of the Thames, at
the distance of between forty and fifty miles east from
London; but every one does not know that the Isle of
Sheppey is an inexhaustible mine of fossil treasures; and
that from its cliffs, and on its shores, may be gathered
innumerable relics of tropical plants, of quadrupeds, birds,
serpents, turtles, fishes, crabs, lobsters, shells, &amp;c. all belonging
to species that now no longer exist.</p>

<p>A visit to the town of Queenborough afforded me, when a
boy, the first opportunity of beholding fossil remains in
such a state of preservation, and in such profusion, as to
excite in my mind an uncontrollable desire to investigate
the nature and origin of objects which I had been taught to
believe were either produced spontaneously in the earth, or
were left in their present situations by the waters of a universal
deluge. At a short distance from the inn where we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_839" id="Page_839"> 839 </a></span>
sojourned, was a vitriol manufactory, and considerable plots
of ground were covered with the pyritous clay, obtained
from the neighbourhood. To my great astonishment, I perceived
that masses of this fossil earth were almost wholly
made up of stems, twigs, and fragments of wood, with
innumerable fruits, seed-vessels, and berries, of kinds altogether
unknown to me. These fossils were of a dark colour,
some quite black, very heavy, and permeated with the
mineral substance termed sulphuret of iron, or pyrites.
Many were so brittle as to fall to pieces upon being handled,
but others were of a stony hardness, and I quickly filled
a handkerchief with my newly discovered treasures, and
hastened home to examine them at leisure. They consisted
of the usual kinds of fossil fruits so abundant in the island
(see <a href="#lign_63"><i>Lign.</i> 63 and 64</a>, p. 188), with casts of shells, and a
few claws of crabs, and teeth of fishes.</p>

<p>Most of the specimens fell to pieces in the course of
three or four months, but a few were durable, and these
still occupy a corner in my cabinet as precious mementos
of my juvenile researches. Many years afterwards I revisited
Sheppey, and made a large collection of its fossils, which is
now in the British Museum. Of late years, the increasing
taste for Pal&aelig;ontology has brought numerous visitors to
the island, which steam navigation has now placed within a
few hours&#8217; distance of the metropolis; and the demand for
choice fossils has given rise to several local dealers. The
student may, with but little trouble or expense, visit the
island, make himself familiar with its geological character,
and return laden with the fruits of the ancient spice islands,
of whose ruins this mass of clay, in the embouchure of the
Thames, is almost wholly composed. As it is some years
since I last visited this interesting spot, I have obtained, as
a Cicerone for the reader, the most indefatigable and successful
investigator of its fossil Flora, <span class="smcap">Mr. Bowerbank</span>;
and as the courtesy of this gentleman is equal to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_840" id="Page_840"> 840 </a></span>
intelligence and scientific attainments, the traveller will
have no reason to regret the absence of the author. A
trip from London to Sheppey and back, affording time to
procure a good collection of fossils, may be easily accomplished
in three days.</p>


<p class="caption3">EXCURSION TO THE ISLE OF SHEPPEY, BY
J. S. BOWERBANK, ESQ. F.R.S.<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_785" id="Footnote_785"></a><a href="#FNanchor_785"><span class="label">[785]</span></a> Abridged from the Annals of Philosophy, by permission of the
author.</p></div>

<p>"The best conveyance is by the Southend and Sheerness
steam-packets, which leave London-bridge on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, and Saturdays, at 11 o&#8217;clock in the morning,
and reach Sheerness about 4 or 5 o&#8217;clock in the afternoon.
The town is divided into two parts,&mdash;the one contained
within the limits of the garrison being designated the
Blue town, while that beyond the fortifications to the north-east
is designated the Mile-town; and it is to this portion
that I should recommend the visitor to proceed, and take
up his quarters either at the Royal Hotel, or at the Wellington:
the latter is an exceedingly snug and comfortable
house, to which I have resorted for many years. After
having established himself in the inn, he should request the
attendance of Mr. Hays (better known perhaps by the name
of <i>Paddy Hays</i>), from whom he may purchase, at a reasonable
rate, some good fossils, such as crabs, lobsters, heads
and portions of fishes, and numerous species of fossil fruits.
Our traveller will then have accomplished all that can be
done towards the acquisition of fossils until the following
morning; there not being, I believe, any other collector in
the town from whom purchases can be made.</p>

<p>"On the following morning an early breakfast is desirable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_841" id="Page_841"> 841 </a></span>
as a considerable extent of ground is to be traversed. It is
advisable to go provided with live or six sheets of soft paper,
to wrap fragile specimens in; and a few cotton or linen
bags, of about four or five inches in diameter, to separate
the large from the small fossils; the whole to be carried in
a good-sized blue bag, or haversack; a chisel and light
hammer are the only instruments required. If the geologist
has a desire to view the great section of the London
Clay, afforded by the cliffs on the north shore of Sheppey,
and is content with the comparatively few fossils which he
may be able to procure by his own exertions, he may proceed
in the following manner:&mdash;Leaving Sheerness by the
new town, he will pass along the sea-wall, towards Minster,
until he reaches Scaps-gate, where the cliffs begin to rise
from the low lands of the western end of Sheppey. A few
cottages are scattered round this point, some of the inhabitants
of which work upon the beach, collecting either
cement-stone or <i>pyrites</i>, the latter being better known by
the name of <i>copperas</i>. To these application should be
made for &#8216;curiosities,&#8217; and very frequently excellent specimens,
and at a small price, may be thus procured. From
this point the route will be under the cliffs upon the
shingle, amidst which, dark patches, ten or fifteen yards in
length, will be observed, composed of nodules of <i>pyrites</i>,
intermixed with pyritized fragments of branches of trees, in
great abundance. It is at such spots that the numerous
and beautiful specimens of fossil fruits are found; but, to
ensure success, the collector must be content to go upon his
knees, and carefully search among the fragments. The
whole of the beach, from about the parallel of Minster
church to Warden Point, abounds with these patches of
<i>pyrites</i>; and I have by this means obtained in the course of
a morning upwards of one hundred fine fruits of various
sizes. Care must be taken in such an investigation of the
coast, that it be undertaken during the falling of the tide,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_842" id="Page_842"> 842 </a></span>
or unpleasant consequences may arise from being shut in
between the banks of mud which are projected into the sea
at many points of the coast.</p>

<p>"If the principal object be the attainment of the greatest
quantity of fossils, a different course should be pursued.
The collector should then, after having made his purchases
at Scaps-gate, direct his steps towards Minster church,
passing which, he will proceed on the road towards Warden.
About three-quarters of a mile beyond the church there
is a lane on the left hand, leading towards the Royal Oak,
in which lives a woman named Mummery, and several
others, who work upon the beach, and from whom fossils
are frequently to be procured. These people will direct
him to the cottage of a family named Crockford, who have
usually a good assortment of fossils; and to many other
parties who also work upon the beach, and reside between
this point and Hensbrook, to which place he must now
direct his steps. At Hensbrook inquiry should be made for
a man named Pead, who has generally a considerable
number of good specimens in his possession. From this
point (Hensbrook) the collector must proceed along the
top of the cliff towards Warden, calling at the various
cottages in his way, until he arrives at Warden Point, at
which place he must inquire for Mud-row, many of the
inhabitants of which work upon the beach, and from whom
a considerable addition to the specimens already collected
may be purchased. Beyond this point nothing will be
obtained, and the best way to return to Sheerness, is by the
road which runs through the most level portion of the
country; the path along the north cliff undulates very
considerably more than the road.</p>

<p>"The course of proceeding thus sketched applies to the
supposition that the time is limited to three days, but if a
longer period can be spared, I should recommend the
tourist not to leave Sheerness without viewing the dock-yard;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_843" id="Page_843"> 843 </a></span>
and the return to London may be made by the way
of Chatham and Gravesend, affording the gratification of a
view of the dock-yard and lines at Chatham, and of the
fine old cathedral and castle at Rochester; at the same
time, enabling him to arrive in London on the evening of
the day that he quits Sheerness."</p>

<div class="sidenote">HERNE BAY. GRAVESEND.</div>

<p>If the student&#8217;s time will permit, a day or two may be
profitably spent at Herne Bay on his return; and search
should be made for fossils under Swale Cliff and Studd Hill,
where numerous fruits and some unique mammalian remains
have been found by William Richardson, Esq. (see p. 791).
Should he land at Gravesend, as recommended by Mr. Bowerbank,
he should proceed towards the lime-kilns which lie on
the London side of the pier, on the right bank of the Thames.
To the left of the lime-kilns he will perceive a road leading
by some bold chalk cliffs to the high ground above Gravesend;
and on the right hand there is a row of cottages, or
rather huts, inhabited by the labourers that work in the
quarries and kilns. Many of the usual fossils of the Kentish
Chalk may be obtained of the women or children in these
huts; and sometimes <i>Cidares</i>, or turban Echinites (p. 314),
with spines; and Star-fish (p. 306). A visit to the chalk-pits
at Purfleet, on the opposite side of the river, is very
desirable; many interesting fossils having been found in
that locality. The Kentish Chalk in this district is much
softer than that of Sussex, and the fossils may be easily
cleared with a penknife, or by brushing in water; care
should be taken not to wash them roughly, as they will
readily separate from the chalk.</p>

<p>The fossils procured from the Isle of Sheppey, by such
an excursion, will probably consist of portions of stems and
branches of trees, and fragments of wood, perforated by
Teredines (see p. 193); specimens of the fruits of palms,
resembling the recent <i>Nipas</i> of the Moluccas (p. 188), and
of plants allied to the Cucumber, Bean, Cypress, Laburnum,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_844" id="Page_844"> 844 </a></span>
&amp;c. (p. 189); claws and fragments of the shields of Crabs
(p. 512); bones of Crocodiles, Serpents, and Turtles; bones
and teeth of Sharks (p. 591); Rays (p. 598), and other
fishes; and several species of the usual shells of the London
Clay (p. 383), and a specimen or two of Nautilus (p. 469).</p>


<p class="caption3">NOTES FOR AN EXCURSION TO BRACKLESHAM BAT, ON THE
WESTERN COAST OF SUSSEX.</p>

<p>The line of low cliffs extending from Selsea Bill to the
mouth of Chichester Harbour exhibits a section of the
Eocene deposits, varying in height from five or six feet to
ten or twelve; it is covered at its base by a bed of shingle,
fifteen or twenty yards wide, that extends towards the sea.
The space between the termination of the shingle and the
limit of low-water-mark is occupied by a bed of dark grey
and greenish sand; and at certain seasons, numberless specimens
of the fossil shells common in the Eocene strata of the
London and Paris basins are thickly spread over this area.</p>

<p>Mr. Webster first directed attention to this locality, in
his celebrated Memoir on the Tertiary Strata of England;
and my friend, the late John Hawkins, Esq. of Bignor Park,
followed up the inquiry. In 1821 I made a fine collection
of the Bracklesham fossils, and published a list of them in
<i>Foss. South D.</i> and <i>Geol. S. E.</i> Messrs. Bowerbank, Saull,
Dixon, Coombe, &amp;c. have subsequently made considerable
and important additions to the catalogue; and besides
many new species of shells, the vertebr&aelig; and other bones
of Turtles, Serpents, and Crocodiles have been discovered.
An excellent notice of this locality, from the pen of Mr.
Bowerbank, appeared in <i>Mag. Nat. Hist.</i> (1840); and I am
indebted to the kindness of the author for the following
notes for the guidance of my readers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_845" id="Page_845"> 845 </a></span></p>

<p class="smaller">"The part of the bay most interesting to the geologist is that
immediately in the neighbourhood of Bracklesham Barn, especially
at about a furlong to the east of that spot, where there is a small
break or chine in the low clay cliff. At this place, and at a few paces
east and west of it, beneath about six or seven feet of clay, there is
a stratum of light green marly sand, abounding in remains of <i>Venericardia
planicosta</i> and other shells, but which is often entirely
hidden by thrown-up shingle, and it is very rarely that more than a
few feet in length of this bed can be seen. It is from this bed, or
from one exceedingly like it, somewhat lower in the series, that perhaps
most of the interesting shells of this district are to be procured.
If we proceed from this little break or chine westward, for about
forty paces parallel to the coast, and then in the direction of a line
at right angles to the cliff, and at the time of low water, we shall find,
near the low-water-mark, the bed we have described as abounding in
fossils exposed by the action of the sea in the most favourable
manner. At this spot <i>Venericardia planicosta</i> is found literally by
thousands, with the valves united, the shells resting upon their edges,
and packed close to each other, exactly in the manner that we might
expect to have found them, supposing them to have been recent
shells with the animals yet inhabiting them. Comparatively very
few are gaping, and their condition and position strikingly impress
upon the mind the idea that when alive they must have inhabited
the spot from which they are now disinterred; especially as there are
numerous small and fragile species of other well-known London Clay
shells, which could not have remained whole had they been subjected
to much attrition amid the larger shells surrounding them. On the
sands in the vicinity of this spot, I found large masses of <i>Nummulites
l&aelig;vigatus</i> cemented together, and numerous detached specimens
of the same shell.</p>

<p class="smaller">"At the eastern extremity of this bed, which, at the time of my
visit, was opened for about fifty yards, I found <i>Sanguinolaria Hollowaysii</i>,
a rare and fragile, but very beautiful shell, in a fine state of
preservation. At about twenty or thirty yards westward of the
western end of this interesting patch of shells, there are large blocks
of this bed, which, being of a firmer texture than the surrounding
parts of the deposit, have suffered less from the action of the water,
and project about twelve or eighteen inches above the surrounding
sand, and, by presenting an obstruction to the ebbing tide, they
usually induce the formation of a small pool amidst which they
stand. At the south-eastern side of this pool on one occasion I found
the stratum, which is usually covered by the sand, completely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_846" id="Page_846"> 846 </a></span>
exposed. At this spot there was scarcely a specimen of <i>Venericardia
planicosta</i> to be seen, but instead of this shell, <i>Turritella conoidea</i>
and <i>T. edita</i> were imbedded in a dark green marly sand; and among
them, together with <i>Fusus long&aelig;vus</i> and other well-known London
Clay shells, I found <i>Venericardia acuticostata</i> and <i>V. mitis</i>, and a
splendid specimen of <i>Conus deperditus</i>, fully equal in size to the one
figured by Deshayes. Westward of this point I did not meet with
anything particularly interesting.</p>

<p class="smaller">"About midway between Bracklesham Barn and the Thorney coast-guard
station, a series of patches of a deposit of chalk-flints was
exposed; the first of these was nearly at low-water-mark, and the
remainder of them ran, at short distances from each other, in a
diagonal line towards the coast, nearly in the direction of a straight
line drawn from their western extremity to the Thorney station-houses.
Apparently, this stratum of flints has not, at any time,
exceeded eight inches or a foot in thickness; they are, indeed, so
thinly scattered, as rarely to occur piled upon each other: very few
of them have suffered from attrition, and the greater part retain
their original form and whitened surface. They are imbedded in the
same light green marly sand which I before described as occurring at
the bottom of the London Clay in the neighbourhood of the little
chine near Bracklesham Barn. Amongst the flints there are numerous
remains of the roots of trees, in the state of soft bog-wood;
which indicate that this portion of the strata has been very thinly
covered by the superimposed clay.</p>

<p class="smaller">"Upon one of the bouldered flints, firmly imbedded in the marly
sand. I found the most interesting of the valuable series of fossils
which I had the good fortune to obtain during this excursion,
namely, a fine specimen of <i>Astr&aelig;a</i><a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> attached to the upper and exposed
surface of a flint."</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_786" id="Footnote_786"></a><a href="#FNanchor_786"><span class="label">[786]</span></a> <i>Astr&aelig;a</i>, a species of coral; see p. 262.</p></div>

<p>As to the accommodation that may be procured near
this interesting geological locality, Mr. Bowerbank informs
me that homely fare can be obtained at the little inn at
Bracklesham, but there is only one spare bed. At Selsea,
about six miles distant, there is a much better inn.</p>

<p>Land at Cowes; examine the blocks of fresh-water limestone
along the shore, which abound in shells. Drive to
Alum Bay (<i>Wond.</i> p. 241), taking Calbourn in your route,
where there are quarries of the fresh-water limestone, with
innumerable casts of Paludina, Helix, Bulimus, &amp;c. Put
up at Groves&#8217; Hotel, on the summit of the hill, commanding
a glorious view of Alum Bay, with the Hampshire coast,
and the Isle of Purbeck on the right, and Portland Island
looming in the remote distance; and on the left, the vertical
cliffs of Chalk, and the Needles. The pathway that
leads down to the sea-shore traverses a chasm, separating
Headon-hill on the right, from Alum Bay on the left; in the
former, fresh-water shells&mdash;in the vertical beds of clay, in
the latter, marine shells&mdash;may be obtained in great abundance
and variety.</p>

<p>If you land at Ryde, the small quarries at Binstead are
worthy of constant research, for the chance of mammalian
remains (see p. 791).</p>

<p>The following extract from the splendid work of Sir
Henry Englefield on the Isle of Wight describes certain
geological changes still in progress on the shore near Ryde,
that are well deserving the visitor&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p class="smaller">"A great and very singular change has taken place within no very
distant period of time on the shores of the Solent, near to Ryde;
and which seems to be still sensibly proceeding. When Fielding, in
the year 1753, was at Ryde, on his voyage to Lisbon, he describes
the town as totally inaccessible by sea except at or near high-water;
as the tide, on its recess, left a vast extent of mud, too soft to bear
the lightest weight. This mud-bank is now entirely covered by a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_848" id="Page_848"> 848 </a></span>
stratum of fine white sand, smooth and firm enough to bear wheel-carriages,
and which renders the bathing at all times safe and agreeable.
This bed of sand now reaches to Binstead, having covered at
least two miles of the shore within the last half-century; and the
inhabitants say that it is still extending to the westward. On digging
through the sand, the old mud presently appears, the sand stratum
being very thin. To what cause this change is owing it is difficult to
guess; but it is an example of the alternation of deposits from the
action of the sea, in circumstances apparently unchanged, which may
afford cause for reflection to the geologist."<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a></p>

<p>If the visitor have leisure, he should make a tour of this
interesting island, from Ryde to Shanklin and Ventnor,
along the beautiful scenery of the Under Cliff, formed by
the slips of the Lower Green Sand; to Black Gang Chine,

<p class="caption3">NOTES FOR A GEOLOGICAL EXCURSION, OVER THE CHALK AND WEALDEN
FORMATIONS OF THE SOUTH-EAST OF ENGLAND, FROM LONDON TO
BRIGHTON, AND FROM BRIGHTON TO ROTTINGDEAN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> travelling from London to Brighton by the railway,
the following geological features of the country may be
observed; by a reference to <i>Wond.</i> p. 360, the structure of
this remarkable district may be easily understood.</p>

<p>Leaving the station at London Bridge, the <i>London Clay</i>,
with its characteristic fossils, is seen beyond Deptford, by
New Cross, Sydenham, &amp;c.; and approaching Croydon, beds
of gravel appear, with interspersions of olive-green sand.
These strata belong to the Eocene formation, and lie above
and upon the Chalk. The valley beyond Croydon (Smitham
Bottom), along the side of which the railroad is carried, is
composed of gravel resting on chalk; beyond the station
called <i>Stoat&#8217;s Nest</i>, there is a fine section of the chalk, with
layers of flint, and two parallel seams of marl, at the distance
of six or eight feet from each other. These extend,
with but little interruption, several miles, preserving their
parallelism, although the strata in many places have sustained
considerable disturbance. The Merstham Tunnel,
through the Surrey chalk hills, is now entered. At Merstham
the chalk, chalk-marl, and firestone are intersected, and the
Lower Greensand of Red Hill appears; and from thence to
Horley station, the lower sands and clays of the Chalk
formation are passed over or cut through; affording sections
of sandstone, ironstone, and fuller&#8217;s earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_850" id="Page_850"> 850 </a></span></p>

<p>The strata we have hitherto traversed are of marine
origin, and contain fossil shells, fishes, Crustacea, &amp;c., and
remains of other inhabitants of former oceans. But we now
enter upon the series of river deposits<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> which form the
Wealden, and contain the relics of terrestrial or fresh-water
animals and plants.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_788" id="Footnote_788"></a><a href="#FNanchor_788"><span class="label">[788]</span></a> A limited intercalation of a marine character occurs in the
Hasting Sands of Swanage Bay; this was discovered by Mr. R. A. C.
Austen, and is noticed <i>Quart. Geol. Journ.</i> vol. vii. p. lix.</p></div>

<p>At Horley the weald clay appears, and is succeeded by
sand, sandstone, and shale, to Crawley. Passing through
the tunnel of the Wealden strata, we arrive at Balcombe,
where sandstone in lamin&aelig; and in thick beds, having the
surface at the lines of junction covered with ripple marks,
is seen on each side the railroad; the dip of the strata is to
the <i>north-east</i>. After crossing the deep valley at Balcombe,
over the magnificent viaduct, the line runs along alternations
of sand and clay, dipping <i>south-west</i>; we have thus
passed over what is termed the anticlinal axis of the
Wealden. Arriving at Hayward&#8217;s Heath station, the tunnel
exposes a good section of the Wealden sand, sandstone, shale,
and blue marl or oak-tree clay, to a depth of about thirty-six
yards. The strata are disposed in the same order and
thickness as in the quarries around Cuckfield; namely,
fawn-coloured sand and sandstone, like those of Little Horsted,
with beds of calciferous grit or Tilgate stone; and,
beneath, layers of the blue clay. The strata are very barren
in organic remains; several hours&#8217; research only afforded
imperfect vegetable relics, such as comminuted stems and
leaves of the various species of ferns, which occur in Tilgate
Forest (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 392). Some of the grey laminated
sandstones and shales at this place very closely
resemble certain strata of the Coal measures.</p>

<p>Proceeding over the Weald clay with the Sussex marble
of St. John&#8217;s Common, the line encounters the Lower Greensand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_851" id="Page_851"> 851 </a></span>
of Sussex, at Stone-pound gate. Here then we quit
the fresh-water strata of the Wealden, and again enter upon
the marine deposits of the Chalk-formation. At the foot of
the northern escarpment of the South downs, the Chalk is
penetrated at the base of Clayton Hill, the tunnel running
through the lower members of the Chalk&mdash;the Galt and
Chalk-marl&mdash;and emerging at Piecombe through the White
Chalk; from thence to Brighton, the sections and tunnels
intersect or perforate the same cretaceous deposits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LONDON AND BRIGHTON RAILWAY.</div>

<p>In our traverse we shall have seen that the various strata
cut through, are repeated on the north and south of a line
drawn from east to west through the Forest Ridge (see
<i>Wond.</i> Geol. Map, pl. 1). Thus, the railroad has to pass
through two ranges of chalk hills by tunnels those of
Merstham and Clayton; two principal ridges of Wealden
strata&mdash;at Balcombe and Hayward&#8217;s Heath; and the
Shanklin or Lower Greensand at Red Hill, in Surrey, and
near Hurstpierpoint, in Sussex. There is no railroad in the
kingdom that, in the distance of fifty miles, exhibits geological
phenomena of greater variety or interest.</p>

<p>If the student will refer to <i>Wond.</i> p. 362, the stratification
above pointed out will be better comprehended. The
sections visible on the turnpike road from London to
Brighton are described, <i>Wond.</i> p. 363.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Balcombe station will afford some
sections of easy access; and from Hayward s Heath station,
Cuckfield is about two miles distant. The quarries on the
hill above that town were formerly very productive, and
the usual Wealden fossils may still be obtained; namely,
casts of several species of fresh-water shells (p. 416), scales
and teeth of fishes (<i>Lepidotus</i>, p. 604), bones of reptiles, and
vegetable remains.</p>

<p>A stroll from Kemptown along the sea-shore to Rottingdean
is replete with interest, for the strata of which the
cliffs are composed clearly demonstrate that in very remote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_853" id="Page_853"> 853 </a></span>
periods great changes have taken place in the relative position
of the sea and land along the Sussex coast.</p>

<p>Some years since, the bare face of the Cliffs, from the
entrance to the esplanade of the Chain-pier at the Old
Steyne, to Kemptown, was completely exposed, and presented
a most interesting section of the strata. But at the present
time, as every one knows, no portion of the cliffs is visible
west of the <i>groin</i> below Kemptown and the sections in
my first work (<i>Foss. South D.</i> pl. iv. and v.) are the only
records of the appearances formerly presented, and now concealed
by the sea-wall. Even the cliffs immediately beyond
Kemptown are rapidly diminishing from the action of the
waves, which dash with greater violence against their base in
consequence of the means taken to protect the adjoining
terraces from the encroachments of the sea.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Cliffs east of Kemptown is shown
in the sketch, <a href="#lign_267"><i>Lign.</i> 267</a>. But further along the shore,
towards Rottingdean, in a ravine excavated by the encroachments
of the sea, the ancient chalk-cliff behind the mass of
strata seen above is exposed; this is represented in <i>Lign.</i>
268. A description of the appearances at this point will
elucidate the nature of the strata of which these cliffs are
composed.</p>

<p>Upon examining the shore at low-water, masses of chalk,
covered with fuci (<i>sea-weed</i>), &amp;c. are seen protruding through
the sands; and towards the base of the cliff a bed of sea-beach
is spread upon the sand; a low wall or terrace of
white chalk constitutes the boundary of this shingle, as seen
in <a href="#lign_267"><i>Lign.</i> 267</a>, <i>c</i>. Thus we perceive, that the present shore
is formed by the continuation of the chalk strata of the
neighbouring Downs, partially covered with sand and beach,
which are the detritus of the flints that have been washed
out of previously existing layers of chalk, and ground down
by the action of the waves. Now, along the eastern part of
the coast, towards Rottingdean and Newhaven, the chalk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_854" id="Page_854"> 854 </a></span>
rises into mural precipices immediately from the sea-shore;
but at this place the cliffs are composed of very different
materials.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a></p>

<p>1. In the first place, there is, lying immediately on the
terrace of chalk that forms the boundary-wall of the base of
the cliff (<a href="#lign_267"><i>Lign.</i> 267</a>, <i>c</i>, and <a href="#lign_268"><i>Lign.</i> 268</a>, <i>c c</i>,), a bed of sand
(denoted by the letter <i>o</i>, <a href="#lign_268"><i>Lign.</i> 268</a>), of irregular thickness
and variable extent: from this sand marine shells and the
jaw of a Whale (see <a href="#Page_778">p. 778</a>), have been obtained.</p>

<p>2. Upon the sand is a bed of loose shingle&mdash;a regular sea-beach
appearing in no respect different, to the common
observer, from that forming at the foot of the cliffs at the
present moment; this bed is marked <i>b</i>, in <a href="#lign_267"><i>Lign.</i> 267</a>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_855" id="Page_855"> 855 </a></span>
<a href="#lign_268">268</a>. Upon examining this shingle, it is found to contain
numerous pebbles and boulders of granite, porphyry, syenite,
and other plutonic rocks (see <a href="#Page_34">p. 34</a>), none of which occur in
the present beach. And in this ancient shingle, teeth and
bones of extinct species of Elephant, Horse, and Deer have
been discovered. We have here, then, unquestionable evidence
that this beach has been formed under conditions
altogether different from those which now prevail; for not
only is this shingle-bed elevated above the present sea-level,
but its contents are of such a nature as could not have been
thrown up by the sea, in its present relation to the countries
that form its shores.</p>

<p>3. A series of loosely aggregated calcareous deposits,
obscurely stratified, rests upon this bed of shingle, and forms
the upper portion of the cliff, varying in total thickness
from fifty to one hundred and twenty feet. These strata are
composed of chalk rubble and loam, with flints partially
water-worn, and boulders and pebbles of tertiary sandstone;
the whole promiscuously intermingled, and deposited
in nearly horizontal layers, from one to three or four feet
thick. But the face of the cliff generally presents a weather-worn
and crumbling aspect, and large masses are constantly
falling down, in consequence of the removal of the ancient
shingle, by the effects of the waves at the spring-tides.
From the loose state of aggregation of these beds, the fallen
masses are speedily washed away, but here and there blocks
of great hardness, provincially termed <i>Coombe-rock</i>, remain
upon the shore; and, but a few years since, there was
a group of high rocks of this kind near the Chain-pier.
This compact conglomerate has been produced simply by an
infiltration of calcareous spar, which has cemented together
the fragments of chalk, flint, &amp;c. In some places, this infiltration
has reached the bed of ancient shingle below, and
large blocks are occasionally found, consisting of pebbles of
flint, granite, &amp;c. held together by veins of calc-spar, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_856" id="Page_856"> 856 </a></span>
acicular or needle-like crystals. In these sparry conglomerates,
the teeth and bones of the mammalia previously
noticed are sometimes found.<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_790" id="Footnote_790"></a><a href="#FNanchor_790"><span class="label">[790]</span></a> My daughter discovered part of the lower jaw of a Deer, with
teeth, imbedded in this conglomerate, in a mass on the shore near
Rottingdean.</p></div>

<p>It is in this accumulation of calcareous strata that numerous
bones and teeth of the Mammoth, or fossil Elephant,
have been discovered; I have therefore designated it, the
Elephant-bed, to distinguish it from other loose calcareous
deposits.</p>

<p>As seen immediately beyond Kemptown (<a href="#lign_267"><i>Lign.</i> 267</a>), the
cliffs appear to be entirely composed of the materials above
described; but farther on, the face of the ancient chalk-cliff
is exposed (see <a href="#lign_268"><i>Lign.</i> 268</a>); and if we extend our walk to
Rottingdean, we find in many places the Chalk alone forming
the present cliff; the Elephant-bed and its associated shingle
and sand having been swept away. A like destruction
awaits the remainder of these interesting deposits at no very
distant period.<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_791" id="Footnote_791"></a><a href="#FNanchor_791"><span class="label">[791]</span></a> See <i>Foss. South D.</i> p. 277, pl. iv.; and <i>Geol. S. E.</i> p. 30; <i>Wond.</i>
p. 113.</p></div>

<p>After collecting specimens of the Elephant-bed, both of
the friable varieties, and of the coombe-rock, and a few of
the pebbles of granite, porphyry, &amp;c. from the ancient
beach, and also some of the sand beneath the shingle, to
examine microscopically on our return home, let us sit down
on this mass of fallen chalk, and consider the nature of those
changes in the relative position of the land and sea, which
the phenomena before us appear to indicate.</p>

<p>We have seen that these cliffs are composed of the following
deposits:&mdash;1. The Elephant-bed (<a href="#lign_267"><i>Lign.</i> 267</a> and
268, a); a series of calcareous strata, with bones and teeth
of Elephants, Horses, Deer, and Oxen. 2. An ancient sea-beach
(<i>b</i>), with pebbles and boulders of plutonic rocks, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_857" id="Page_857"> 857 </a></span>
bones of mammalia; and a bed of sand beneath, in which
cetacea and mollusca (apparently of existing species) have
been found. 3. Lastly, the regular Chalk-strata (<a href="#lign_268"><i>Lign.</i> 268</a>,
 <i>c, c</i>), extending far out to sea.</p>

<p>These appearances demonstrate the following sequence of
physical changes, namely&mdash;</p>

<p>1stly. The Chalk terrace (<i>c, c</i>), on which the ancient
shingle-bed (<i>b</i>) rests, was on a level with the sea for a long
period; for this beach must have been formed, like the
modern, by the action of the waves on the then existing
chalk cliffs (see <a href="#lign_268"><i>Lign.</i> 268</a>, <i>Chalk</i>). But there must have
been some cause in operation, by which pebbles and boulders
of granite, porphyry, and other rocks, foreign to our shores,
and bones of Elephants, &amp;c. were thrown up on the strand,
and imbedded in the beach then in the progress of formation.
These transported materials may have been floated to the
Sussex coast by icebergs; an agency by which the delicate
bones and teeth might be deposited without injury, although
surrounded by the water-worn detritus (see p. 43).</p>

<p>2dly. The whole line of coast, with the ancient shingle,
must have subsided to such a depth, as to have allowed of
the deposition of the calcareous strata, forming the Elephant-bed.
And from the absence of gravel and beach, and
the circumstance of the chalk-rubble, of which they are
largely composed, often presenting angular fragments, it
would appear that this deposition took place in some
tranquil bay or inland sea.</p>

<p>Lastly. The land was elevated to its present level; and
at this period the formation of the existing sea-beach and
line of cliffs commenced.</p>

<p>The reader must not conclude, from our remarks being
restricted to the cliffs before us, that the phenomena here
contemplated were limited to this district; on the contrary,
if our space would permit, it might be shown that they are
referable to extensive geological changes, which took place
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_858" id="Page_858"> 858 </a></span>
in the period immediately antecedent to the present. In
all the valleys of the South-east and East of England that
open into the sea, traces, more or less extensive and important,
of similar deposits exist. The level plain, called
the <i>Steyne</i>, at Brighton, is entirely formed of the Elephant-bed,
which extends up the valley to Preston and Patcham;
in the latter place bones and teeth of Elephants have been
found. At Southbourn, the plain at the foot of the Chalk
hills, called "<i>The Wish</i>," containing remains of the Elephant,
Rhinoceros, and Hippopotamus, evidently belongs to the
same epoch. At Folkstone, Mr. H. Carr has discovered
large blocks of <i>Coombe-rock</i>, and Mr. S. J. Mackie abundance
of bones; and at Dover, above the Chalk, similar
masses occur. On the opposite coast of Franco there
are also indications of these deposits. All these phenomena
are no doubt connected with the occurrence of immense
quantities of mammalian remains in the superficial loam,
&amp;c. on the eastern coasts of England, and are referable to
the same geological epoch.</p>

<p>Imbedded in the Chalk, which is exposed at low water
along the shore, very large Ammonites may sometimes be
found between Kemptown and Rottingdean; and numerous
examples of fossil sponges and other amorphozoa (p. 219).</p>

<p>The teeth and bones of mammalia are rare in these cliffs,
and it is not probable that any will be obtained in a first
visit; but from the fishermen and boys seen strolling along
the shore, specimens may often be purchased.</p>

interesting localities of organic remains.</p>

<p>This railroad traverses the <i>Tertiary</i> strata by Ealing,

and pursuing rather a circuitous route to Wallingford,
beyond which station it passes over the <i>Oolite</i>, and displays

<p><span class="smcap">Visit to Farringdon.</span>&mdash;The railway station is reached in
from two to two and a half hours from London; and an
omnibus meets the morning and evening trains, to convey
passengers to the town of Farringdon, which is about five
miles distant.<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> There are two Inns in the town, the Crown

<p>The town is situated in a valley, between Farringdon
Hill, an eminence seen from a considerable distance in the
approach from Oxford, and Badbury Hill (see <a href="#lign_269"><i>Lign.</i> 269</a>).
A small stream divides the town into two tithings, called
Port and West-port, and flows into the Thames on the
north. The summits of the highest eminences near Farringdon
consist of beds of sand and gravel, resting on
Coral Bag and Kimmeridge Clay, and belonging to the
Cretaceous formation, being the littoral deposits in this
area of some sea of that period. The Lower Green or
Shanklin Sand, the Galt, Chalk-marl, and Chalk successively
appear in the valley below Coxwell Furze up to the
White Horse Downs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO FARRINGDON.</div>

<p>I have not observed any organic remains in the strata on
the top of Farringdon and Badbury Hills, but from the pits
in the low country numerous fossil sponges and other <i>amorphozoa</i>
(see pp. 227-229) maybe obtained. One of the
most productive "gravel-pits," as they are here termed, is
situated on the road to Little Coxwell, about three quarters
of a mile from Farringdon. It lies on the left of the road
leading to the pretty village of Shrivenham. In this pit,
the strata consist of a coarse aggregate of siliceous particles,
with some lenticular masses in the state of compact conglomerate;
the lower beds are of a whitish grey, the upper
of a deep ferruginous colour. The Windmill public-house,
close by, is kept by the owner of the pit (Panting), and
specimens of the "petrified salt-cellars" (see <a href="#Page_228">p. 228</a>) and
other sponges may generally be obtained of the inmates;
but the collector, in a few hours, will be able to gather an
extensive and interesting collection; the pick-hammer,
<a href="#lign_266"><i>Lign.</i> 266</a>, <i>fig.</i> 2, will be found the most convenient instrument.
There are two other pits within a moderate distance
of Panting s pit, which are also rich in fossils. The principal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_861" id="Page_861"> 861 </a></span>
organic remains to be obtained from these beds are the
zoophytes figured p. 227, and <i>Wond.</i> p. 637. The reader
should recollect that the beautiful cup-shaped sponge, <i>Chenendopora
fungiformis</i> (<a href="#lign_71"><i>Lign.</i> 71</a>), is the "petrified salt-cellar"
of the quarry-men. As many specimens as possible
of the interesting coral, <i>Verticellipora</i> (p. 227, <a href="#lign_70"><i>Lign. 70,
fig. 4</i></a>,) should be procured, to examine the internal structure
at leisure. The cup-shaped sponges should be collected
uncleared, for they are often full of minute corals,
shells, echinital spines, &amp;c. There are also numerous specimens
to be met with of <i>Terebratul&aelig;</i>, <i>Ostre&aelig;</i>, <i>Nautili</i>, and
other shells; also rolled <i>Belemnites</i> from the Oolite, and
bones of <i>Plesiosauri</i> and <i>Ichthyosauri</i>.</p>

<p>Some shells are extremely numerous; principally of the

fine <i>Belemnites</i> also occur. The oolitic structure is very

<p><span class="smcap">Swindon, Wilts.</span>&mdash;Fourteen miles beyond the Farringdon

Here, when a schoolboy, my curiosity was strongly excited
by the so-called petrified "<i>ram&#8217;s horns</i>," and "<i>oak</i>," so
abundant in the solid masses of stone in the neighbouring
quarries, and which daily came under my notice in my
rambles around the town. It is indeed a locality most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_863" id="Page_863"> 863 </a></span>
prolific in the Ammonites and other shells, and in the
fossil wood peculiar to the upper division of the Oolite
formation&mdash;the Portland beds; the hill on which the town
is built consisting of those strata; the Kimmeridge Clay,
on which they rest, is exposed in the railway cuttings in the
valley on the north. There are two little Inns, the Bell
and the Goddard Arms, where the visitor may meet with
accommodation. The quarries, which are in the immediate
vicinity of the town, abound in Ammonites, Trigoni&aelig;,
and other shells: and some layers are entirely composed of
the casts of several species. The Ammonites are principally
of two kinds, viz. <i>A. biplex</i> and <i>A. triplicatus</i>, and
vary in size from a few inches to upwards of three feet in
diameter; the specimens are casts only, no vestiges of the
shells remaining. At Aylesbury the same species occur in
clay, with the shells entire (see <a href="#Page_481">p. 481</a>). A large collection
may be made in a few hours; and from some of the quarry-men
the less common forms may probably be obtained.
Casts of the bivalves called <i>Gervillia</i> and <i>Perna</i> abound in
the quarry on the right hand of the road. I have collected
from this place, in addition to those above mentioned, casts
of the genera <i>Buccinum</i>, <i>Cardium</i>, <i>Cytherea</i> or <i>Venus</i>,
<i>Nerita</i>, <i>Terebra</i>, <i>Pullastra</i>, <i>Pecten</i>; and of the large species
of <i>Pleurotomaria</i> which occurs in the Kimmeridge clay of

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO CHIPPENHAM AND CALNE.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Chippenham and Calne.</span>&mdash;In from three and a half to
four hours the traveller from London reaches the town of
Chippenham, ninety-three miles from London, and situated
on the Oxford clay; the locality where Mr. William Bye
obtained those interesting specimens of <i>Belemnoteuthis</i>, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_864" id="Page_864"> 864 </a></span>
contain vestiges of the soft bodies and arms (see <a href="#Page_459">page 459</a>,
and <a href="#lign_145"><i>Lign.</i> 145</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calne</span>, about six miles from Chippenham, stands on
Oolitic limestone; and the quarries around the town have
long been celebrated for the perfection and abundance of
their fossil remains; particularly of various species of the
turban echinites (<i>Cidarites</i>, see <a href="#Page_316">p. 316</a>), and their spines.
A day or two at each of these towns will be well spent by
the geologist and the collector of organic remains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bath and Bristol.</span>&mdash;The immediate vicinities of these
cities are rich in interesting localities for the geologist. A
visit to the public museums in Bath and Bristol cannot fail
to gratify the student, and will at once point out to him the
places most worthy his examination. That of Bristol is
admirably arranged, and contains, among other treasures,
the specimen of fossil <i>Squaloraia</i> (see <a href="#Page_596">p. 596</a>); the remains
of the reptiles of the magnesian conglomerate, the <i>Thecodontosaurus</i>
(<a href="#Page_713">p. 713</a>); and the celebrated collection of
Crinoidea (<a href="#Page_283">p. 283</a>) formed by the late Mr. Miller.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO CLIFTON.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Clifton.</span>&mdash;The stupendous rocks of mountain limestone
which flank both sides of the Avon in its course from
Clifton to the Severn are too well known to render a
general description necessary, and our limits will not admit
of details. The geological student should first obtain a
<i>coup d&#8217;&#339;il</i> of the appearance and position of the strata, by
sailing down to the embouchure of the river in a steam-packet,
and afterwards visit on foot the most interesting
localities. On the right bank of the river, near the "Black
Rock," the teeth of several kinds of fishes of the genera
<i>Psammodus</i> (<a href="#Page_587">p. 587</a>), <i>Hybodus</i> (<a href="#Page_591">p. 591</a>), <i>Ceratodus</i> (<a href="#Page_587">p. 587</a>),
&amp;c. may be obtained, and shells and corals of the mountain
limestone. Polished specimens of the coralline marbles
may be purchased at the shops.</p>

<p><i>Portishead</i>, a pretty little village on the south-east bank
of the Severn, is well worth a visit; and, by going in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_865" id="Page_865"> 865 </a></span>
morning steamer and returning in the evening, several
hours may be agreeably spent along the shore below the
hotel; and fossil plants and shells, from the blocks of millstone
grit, and numerous rock specimens may be collected.</p>

<p>A sail to <i>Chepstow</i>, and up the Wye as far as Tintern
Abbey, returning on foot, or in a carriage, by Piercefield to
Chepstow, is an excursion replete with the highest interest
and enjoyment. The picturesque beauties of the Wye are
dependent, like those of Clifton and Matlock, on the disruptions
which the strata of mountain limestone have
sustained. The magnificent scenery as we pass up the
river, and the interesting associations connected with the
ruins of Tintern Abbey, cannot fail to delight the traveller;
but the enchanting scene that bursts upon the sight from
the heights of Piercefield is magnificent in the extreme,
and equal to the grandest views on the Rhine. Looking
down from those elevated pinnacles of rock, which are
covered with the most luxuriant vegetation, and crested
with forests of pine, oak, and beech, we perceive the Wye
pursuing its tortuous course at our feet, and winding along,
around promontories of limestone, towards Chepstow; while
immediately beyond, and apparently separated from the
opposite bank of the river only by a precipitous rampart or
mountain limestone, the Severn appears as a vast inland
sea, bounded in the remote distance by the country around
Gloucester, and extending on the right to the Bristol
Channel.</p>


<p>Among other interesting geological sites within a few
miles of Clifton and Bristol, may be mentioned&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Aust Cliff; a section of the Lias, from which many
interesting fossils have been procured.</p>

<p>2. Banwell Cave; which is particularly deserving of
examination (see p. 809).</p>

<p>3. Cheddar Cliffs; which are equally interesting to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_866" id="Page_866"> 866 </a></span>
geologist and to the lover of picturesque scenery. They
are about twenty miles from Bristol; and a carriage and
pair will be required, if the visitor intends to return the
same day. The best arrangement is to visit the cavern at
Banwell, remain in the neighbouring town the following
night, and make an excursion to Cheddar Cliffs the next
day.</p>

<p>There has lately been opened at Cheddar a cavern which
surpasses in the beauty of its stalactites any hitherto discovered
in England. The Rev. W. D. Conybeare states,
that it is the only one that at all realizes any idea we have
of the far-famed <i>Grotto of Antiparos</i>. It consists of one
grand arch, or porch, and three or four lateral branches
and narrow fissures, about ten or twelve feet broad, and
from thirty to forty feet high, vested and draped with the
most fantastic hangings of stalactite. The floor is a mass
of stalagmite, covering a bed of gravel of the mountain
limestone, which fills up about ten feet of the bottom. I
am not aware that any fossil bones have been observed.</p>

<p>When visiting Banwell, inquiry should be made if there
be any Cave at Hutton accessible to the visitor.</p>


<p>The above remarks must be regarded only as suggestions;
for it would require a volume to particularize the geological
objects of interest within a short distance of Bristol. The
coal-mines in the neighbourhood of Bath and Bristol should
be visited, and fossil plants collected.</p>

<p>The beautiful and romantic Dale of Matlock, although
one hundred and forty-two miles distant, is now brought
within nine hours of the metropolis. Leaving London from
the Euston-square station of the Birmingham Railway, at
eleven o&#8217;clock (taking the precaution to have a ticket that
will ensure a passage from Rugby by the <i>Midland</i> Counties
Railroad to Derby), we pass over in succession the clays,
sands, and beds of gravel, composing the <i>Tertiary</i> strata of
the London basin; and at Watford, steep cuttings of these
deposits are seen on each side of the station. A long
tunnel through the <i>White Chalk</i> of Hertfordshire is then
passed; and at Tring we arrive at the termination of the
Chalk, and obtain a fine view of the north-west escarpment
of the Downs, which is seen extending on the right towards
Ivinghoe, and attaining an elevation of 900 feet. The
railway then proceeds over the Chalk-marl, Galt, and
Lower Greensand, to near Leighton, where these members
of the Cretaceous system are succeeded by the <i>Oolite</i> of
Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire; and the line
crosses the Grand Junction Canal near the emergence of
the <i>Lias</i>; the Rugby station being situated in the midst of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_868" id="Page_868"> 868 </a></span>
that formation. We then enter the Midland Counties line,
and pass on to Stoney Stanton, where the Lias terminates,
and the <i>Triassic</i> or <i>New Red</i> strata appear; proceeding
towards Leicester, clays and marls of a dull red colour,
denoting the Triassic deposits, constitute the slopes on each
side the railway. As we approach Leicester, the craggy
summits of Charnwood Forest appear in the distance On the
left, with here and there an isolated conical hill, indicating
the protruded masses of granite, porphyry, and syenite,
which belong to the group of plutonic rocks of the central
county of England. The granitic mass of Mount Sorel is
seen along the railway from Sileby to Barrow, Charnwood
Forest appearing in the distance.</p>

<p>Leaving Leicester for Derby, the route continues along
Triassic strata; and a good section of the variegated marls,
with veins of white fibrous gypsum, may be observed at
<i>Red Hill</i>, where a short tunnel perforates a ridge of the
same deposits. The railroad then emerges on the verdant
alluvial plain through which the Trent, its waters increased
by the confluence of the Dove and the Soar, pursues its
course towards the north, and joins the Humber at Alkborough,
whence the united streams flow on, and empty
themselves into the German Ocean.</p>

<p>At Derby, where the train arrives at half-past five, half
an hour is allowed for dinner; and we then proceed by the
<i>North Midland</i> line, by Duffield and Helper, through a
beautiful valley watered by the Derwent, which is seen
winding its way towards Derby. The high grounds skirting
this valley are composed of the millstone-grit and sandstone
of the Carboniferous system (see <a href="#Page_31">p. 31</a>). Ten miles
beyond Derby, we arrive at Amber Gate station, where an
omnibus and other conveyances are in waiting, to convey
passengers to Cromford and Matlock.<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_794" id="Footnote_794"></a><a href="#FNanchor_794"><span class="label">[794]</span></a> As it frequently happens that more passengers are brought by
the train, than the omnibus or coach can convey, some activity is
necessary to secure an outside place, which it is most desirable for the
s geological tourist to possess, that he may command a good view of
the splendid scenery, which will be constantly opening on his sight,
through the romantic pass that leads to Matlock.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO MATLOCK DALE.</div>

<p>The road from Amber Gate leads through a succession of
picturesque scenes of surpassing beauty. At Whatstandwell-bridge<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a>
(see <a href="#lign_273"><i>Lign.</i> 273</a>), over which the Derwent is crossed,
the view is most imposing. The river is seen rapidly pursuing
its course between richly wooded ravines, fringed with
luxuriant foliage to the water&#8217;s edge.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> As we advance, the
bold mountain ridge of <i>Crich Hill</i> appears on the light,
with the village of Holloway at a considerable elevation,
and Lea Mills near the base of the range; while on the
left are the hills and overhanging woods of Alderwasley.
Ascending to the Inn at Cromford, the road turns suddenly
to the right, and by an opening cut through a mass
of strata twenty feet thick, called <i>Scarthing Rock</i>, conducts
to the southern entrance of Matlock Dale. On passing this
chasm, the glorious features of this enchanting region burst
on the view. On the east is a range of limestone cliffs,
richly wooded, with Willersley Castle, the seat of the Arkwrights,
embosomed in trees on a commanding eminence;
and on the west, a rocky precipice, crested with forests, and
its sides partially covered with copses and brushwood;
while the river, dashing through the ravine on the right,
completes the magic of the picture&mdash;</p>

<p>At the distance of about half a mile, we pass the toll-gate,
and a bold mural precipice of mountain limestone suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_870" id="Page_870"> 870 </a></span>
appears on the eastern bank of the river; while on the
western, a steep slope, clothed with verdure, rises rapidly to
the lofty pine-clad eminence called <span class="smcap">Masson Hill</span>, an elevation
of upwards of 1,000 feet. The base of this mountain
stretches directly across the dale in front, and apparently
presents a barrier to an egress from the valley on the
north; but as we advance, the road is seen to wind round
its foot by a defile along the left bank of the river; and the
magnificent rock called the <span class="smcap">High Tor</span> rises in majestic
grandeur on the right. The valley now gradually expands,
and, at the distance of about two and a half miles from the
entrance at Scarthing&#8217;s rock, terminates in the champaign
country beyond Matlock village.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> From the precipitous
nature of the escarpment of mountain limestone which
forms the eastern boundary of the dale, the buildings at
Matlock Bath are confined to the left or western side of the
Derwent, and are scattered here and there among the trees,
on the projecting plots and terraces formed by the fallen
cliffs of sandstone, which, during the lapse of ages, have
become partially disintegrated and are more or less concealed
by vegetable soil; the projecting rocks are covered
with lichens, mosses, and ferns.</p>

<p>The hotels, of which there are several, are all delightfully
situated; but the <i>Temple Hotel</i>, which stands on a
terrace on the side of Masson Hill, about a hundred feet
above the river, has the preference in my estimation; its
elevated situation, its seclusion from the noise and bustle
of the village, and its bowers and hedge-rows of sweet-briar
and roses, imparting a character of sylvan beauty to the
spot, peculiarly grateful to the traveller who wishes to enjoy
a quiet sojourn at Matlock Dale. The local guide-books

<div class="sidenote">LONDON TO MATLOCK.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Position of Matlock Dale.</span>&mdash;That the
reader may clearly comprehend the geological character of
the romantic district in which he is now situated, we will
briefly enumerate the several formations over which we
passed, in our rapid transit from London; by the aid of the
geological map, the following description will be easily
comprehended.</p>

<p>Our route from the metropolis commenced from the centre
of the <i>Tertiary</i> strata, upon which London is situated, and
which fills up an extensive depression or basin in the Chalk;
we then passed over, or rather (by the tunnel) through the
north-west boundary of the <i>Chalk</i> basin, and successively
came upon the <i>Portland</i> stone and other beds of the <i>Oolite</i>,
and the <i>Lias</i>; the strata of these formations successively
rising from beneath each other as we proceeded. In Leicestershire,
the beds of the <i>New Red</i> or <i>Triassic</i> formation emerged
from under the Lias; and at the Trent Junction the nature
of the deposits was concealed by the alluvial plains of the
river. Beyond Derby, we entered upon strata of the <i>Carboniferous</i>
system, the <i>Millstone grits</i> and <i>sandstones</i>, and
finally reached the Mountain limestone and its associated
<i>Magnesian limestones</i>, which compose the mountainous district
of Derbyshire. The following diagram will serve to
illustrate this description.</p>

<div class="fig_center" style="width: 482px;">
<img src="images/txt_pg_871.png" width="482" height="140" alt="" />
<div class="fig_caption"><p>]</p></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_872" id="Page_872"> 872 </a></span></p>

<p>The immediate vicinity of Matlock is, therefore, a region
of Carboniferous limestone and millstone strata, which, as
we have previously explained (see p. 31), are of marine
origin; and those beds that contain organic remains abound
in extinct species of shells and crinoidea. These rocks are
also the grand depository of the ores of lead (see <i>Wond.</i>
p. 681), calamine, &amp;c., and contain a variety of minerals of
great beauty and interest. This district has also been the
theatre, in very remote periods, of great physical changes,
and the strata have been upheaved and displaced by volcanic
action, the solid rocks rent asunder, and beds of
mineral substances, rendered fluid by intense heat, have
been injected between the layers, and into the fissures of
the sedimentary strata; to these revolutions, the present
bold and picturesque features of the country are attributable.
Here then are phenomena replete with the highest
interest; the very beds of lava may still be seen&mdash;the rents
and fissures caused by their explosive action, and now lined
with rich metallic ores and spars, may be examined&mdash;and
the thermal waters, rising in perpetual fountains from an
incalculable depth, testify that the internal fires, the sources
of these catastrophes, though latent, are not extinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MATLOCK INCRUSTING SPRINGS.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A Walk to the Incrusting Springs.</span>&mdash;The so-called
"petrifying springs and wells" of Derbyshire are celebrated
throughout England for the incrusted birds&#8217; nests, baskets,
&amp;c. which are very generally purchased by visitors, as mementos
of a trip into this county. The nature of this
deposition of calcareous matter has already been explained
(see p. 39; and <i>Wond.</i> p. 75); and, although the objects
above mentioned are scarcely worthy of notice, the natural
operations by which the tufa and travertine are produced,
are extremely interesting.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_799" id="Footnote_799"></a><a href="#FNanchor_799"><span class="label">[799]</span></a> If the proprietors of these springs could be induced to follow
the example of the Italians at San Filippo (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 75), or of
the French, in Auvergne, or the Germans at Carlsbad, elegant bas-reliefs
and other beautiful objects might be obtained, for the incrusting
power of the Matlock waters is very considerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_873" id="Page_873"> 873 </a></span></p></div>

<p>Our first stroll shall therefore be to the beds of tufa which
have been formed in remote ages by this operation and
which now constitute the terrace on which the Old Bath
and two other hotels, and the elegant modern Church are
situated. Proceeding from our Inn, the tufaceous rock may
be seen protruding in masses on the right hand, in front of
the beautiful parterres of the hotels; and upon crossing the
road, where a narrow path leads down to the bed of the
river, and nearly opposite to the new church, the lower beds
of tufa are exposed in a quarry, from which large blocks of
the coarse, porous stone are extracted for grotto and rock-work.
From this spot I collected very fine impressions
of the foliage of the oak, elm, and hazel, leaves of adder&#8217;s
tongue (<i>scolopendrium</i>), &amp;c. and large portions of moss,
beautifully incrusted.<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_800" id="Footnote_800"></a><a href="#FNanchor_800"><span class="label">[800]</span></a> I could not obtain any specimens of this kind from the quarry-men
nor from the shops or museums, as they are termed; such
objects not being deemed "curiosities" by the good folks of Matlock;
and the workmen forbade me to search for more in the quarry!</p></div>

<p>The origin of this deposit of tufa, which covers so huge
an area along the western flank of the mountain range of
Masson Hill, is attributable to the thermal springs having,
at some very remote period, issued from a much higher
source than at present, and flowing down the side of the
hill into the river at its foot, the water, as it cooled, deposited
the lime with which it was charged on the stems,
branches, leaves, and other extraneous bodies. At this time
the springs escape from crevices in the rocks at an elevation
of about one hundred feet above the bed of the river; the
waters, at their source, have a temperature of from 66&deg; to
68&deg;, and contain free carbonic acid and minute quantities
of muriates and sulphates of magnesia, lime, and soda.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_874" id="Page_874"> 874 </a></span>
Their origin is now concealed, and the water conducted by
pipes to the various baths and fountains; but wherever a
rill escapes, and flows down the hill, the moss, &amp;c. is quickly
incrusted. I was informed, that in about eight mouths a
basket of eggs would be entirely enveloped in a thick mass
of tufa. The uniform high temperature of these waters
shows that they emanate from a very deep source; and it is
probable that they originate from steam, which is cooled and
condensed as it approaches the surface of the earth. The
miners assured me, that the springs burst out from beneath
the volcanic rock, here termed <i>toadstone</i>, and that the water,
when it first issues, is of a higher temperature than the
Matlock Bath water; but its heat is reduced by the cool
land-springs with which it becomes intermingled.</p>

<p>Most waters that flow through limestone districts deposit
travertine more or less abundantly; and I observed several
streams in my rambles in the neighbourhood of Matlock
which appeared to possess this property in as great a degree
as the thermal springs. There is a lovely waterfall, which
issues from the side of a mountain that flanks the road
leading by Via Gellia to Middleton Moor, at an elevation of
two hundred feet, and flows into the adjacent valley, bounding
and dancing from one mossy knoll to another, and appearing
from the opposite hill like a stream of molten silver,
undulating through a carpet of emerald green. The waters
of this cascade have formed a thick bed of travertine along
the side of the hill; and the stone is of so firm a texture,
that the walls of a cottage hard by are constructed of it.</p>

<p>I gathered from the banks of this waterfall, bundles of moss
and groups of small shells incrusted with a beautiful white
tufa; and impressions of leaves, twigs, &amp;c. were observable
in the blocks of travertine recently quarried.</p>

<p>In contemplating the effects produced by these limpid
streams, by which perishable leaves and fragile shells are
preserved for ages in solid masses of rock, we are reminded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_875" id="Page_875"> 875 </a></span>
of the forcible and eloquent remarks of Sir Humphry Davy,
when observing similar phenomena in the volcanic regions
of Italy. "How marvellous are those laws, by which even
the humblest types of organic existence are preserved
though born amidst the sources of their destruction; and
by which a species of immortality is given to generations,
floating, as it were, like evanescent bubbles on a stream
raised from the deepest caverns of the earth, and instantly
losing what may be called its spirit in the atmosphere!"<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CAVERN OF THE HIGH TOR.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Visit to the Cavern of the High Tor.</span>&mdash;After the
visitor has taken a general view of the romantic scenery
around him, a visit to the cavern at the foot of the High
Tor will enable him to comprehend the nature of those
physical changes which have imparted to this district its
picturesque character. Descending into the valley and
passing northwards, through the only street in Matlock Bath,
along the banks of the Derwent, which are beautifully overshadowed
by copses and forest trees, the bold cliff of mountain
limestone, called the High Tor, the most imposing
feature in the dale, suddenly appears on the right bank of
the river. This rock rises to the height of four hundred
feet; the upper half forming a bare and nearly perpendicular
wall of limestone; the lower portion being concealed
by brushwood and luxuriant foliage to the river s edge. At
this spot, a rude wooden hand-rail is stretched across the
Derwent, which is here of considerable breadth, and dashes
along over fallen masses of rock in its course towards the
south. The High Tor (<a href="#lign_270"><i>Lign.</i> 270</a>) consists of a capping of
Drift and of Millstone grit (2); of a series of beds of limestone
with encrinites and shells, slightly inclined southward
(1); of a layer of volcanic matter, termed in Derbyshire
<i>toadstone</i>, from its mottled yellow and greenish appearance
(3); and of a bed of <i>Trap</i>, or <i>toadstone</i> (<i>b</i>), at the base, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_876" id="Page_876"> 876 </a></span>
near the floor at the entrance of the fissure or excavation in
the limestone forming the cavern (<i>a</i>); which trap rock also
appears on the opposite bank of the river (<i>c</i>), beneath the
highly inclined and dislocated masses of limestone, forming
part of the base of Masson Hill. The upper bed of <i>toadstone</i>
(3) cannot be seen, for the face of the cliff (although
represented bare for the sake of perspicuity in the plan,
<a href="#lign_270"><i>Lign.</i> 270</a>) is entirely concealed, half-way up, by dense
foliage; but an intelligent miner assured me that such was
the fact, and that, in sinking a shaft in the opposite hill,
<i>toadstone</i> was found in a corresponding situation. Upon
entering the cavern, which is not of considerable extent, the
first phenomenon to be observed is the bed of <i>toadstone</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_877" id="Page_877"> 877 </a></span>
which protrudes near the floor, beneath a stratum of limestone.
The limestone in contact with the trap is in some
places changed to a light green colour, and has a slaty texture,
from the effects of intense heat under great pressure;
it is often permeated with veins of pyrites, and white calcareous
spar. The inner recesses of the cavern are literally
covered, both on the floor and sides, with very large rhomboidal
crystals of carbonite of lime, of the form commonly
called <i>dog-tooth spar</i>; the cave surpasses, in this respect,
every other in Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Within a few hundred yards of the cavern, a gallery has
been driven into the cliff, and a vein of lead (<i>galena</i>) discovered,
and worked with some success. Tine masses of
blue fluor (provincially termed <i>blue John</i>) and double refracting
calcareous spar were also obtained. On the opposite
bank of the Derwent, beneath the limestone, and
extending along the road-side for two or three hundred
yards, a bed of <i>toadstone</i>, evidently the continuation of that
at the base of the High Tor, is distinctly exposed.</p>

<p>Proceeding northwards, the line of mural precipices, of
which the High Tor is the most elevated point, gradually
descends; but there is a bold and bare rock, called the
Church Tor, from the church of the village of Matlock being
situated near its summit, that requires particular remark;
for on the face of this cliff the strata present a series of
curves, or rather arches, nowhere broken, but having such
an appearance as would result from an expansive force from
beneath uplifting a group of horizontal strata, while yet in
a soft or plastic state. The upper beds of limestone at the
Church Tor abound in marine shells (<i>Spirifer</i>, see p. 390,
particularly the large species, <i>S. giganteus</i>). Such are the
appearances presented by the strata in this locality, on the
right bank of the Derwent. On the opposite side of the valley
are beds of limestone, many of them varying in mineral
constitution from those we have examined, being of a light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_878" id="Page_878"> 878 </a></span>
yellowish dun or cream colour (hence called <i>Dun-stone</i>), and
containing magnesia; in these strata traces of fossil plants
are occasionally found. These magnesian limestones are of
a granular texture and extremely hard; they are said to be
very rich in lead and calamine, and have been extensively
worked. The prevailing rocks on this (the western) side of
the valley belong to this group.</p>


<div class="sidenote">FORMATIONS OF DERBYSHIRE.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Geological Formations of Derbyshire.</span>&mdash;Before we proceed
on our walk, let us sit down awhile on this mossy bank,
beneath the magnificent knoll of trees that here overshadows
the river, and, by a reference to the geological
table (p. 31) and the geological map, obtain a clear idea of
the nature and succession of the strata around us; in other
words, the order of superposition of the deposits of Derbyshire.</p>

<p>1. <i>Lowermost.</i> A bed of compact <span class="smcap">Basalt</span> or <span class="smcap">Trap</span> (in Derbyshire
called <i>Toadstone</i>), of uncertain thickness and extent. This rock
consists of mineral matter that has undergone complete fusion, and
been erupted from the profound depths of some internal source of
intense heat (see <i>Wond.</i> pp. 684, 848). The upheaving force thus
put in action having been unequally exerted in different places, the
superincumbent beds of limestone have been protruded in dome-shaped
masses through the upper strata; and are now seen bent and
curved, forming what is termed arched stratification.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_802" id="Footnote_802"></a><a href="#FNanchor_802"><span class="label">[802]</span></a> My excellent friend, the late Robert Bakewell, Esq., was the
first geologist who correctly explained the phenomena here described.
See his Introduction to Geology, 5th edit. p. 147.</p></div>

<p><i>Vesicular</i> or <i>amygdaloidal</i> Toadstone. This partakes more of the
character of scori&aelig;, being full of little cells or cavities formed by air
bubbles; when these cavities are filled with other mineral matter, as
is often the case, the rock is termed amygdaloidal. This bed of Trap
was formerly considered to be distinct from the lowermost; but it is
now supposed, and with much probability, that all the masses of
igneous rock that pierce, or are intercalated with, the sedimentary
strata, have sprung from one common source, and are but lateral
protrusions from some grand mass of erupted materials.<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_879" id="Page_879"> 879 </a></span></p></div>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Limestones</span> with intervening layers of clay, and Magnesian
limestones, or Dunstones.</p>

<p>3. Alternation of <span class="smcap">Limestone</span> and <span class="smcap">Shale</span>. Many of these limestones
abound in organic remains; and it is in this group that the
ornamental marbles of Derbyshire are comprised. The upper beds
are generally of a slaty texture, and contain layers and nodules of
chert, which often afford exquisite siliceous casts of the stems of
<i>Crinoidea</i> (pulley-stones, see p. 284; and <i>Wond.</i> p. 650), and shells;
white chert or porcelain-stone, and black jasper or flinty slate also
occur in these beds.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">Millstone Grit</span> and <span class="smcap">Shale</span>, and coarse sandstones; these form
the subsoil of the principal heights of the mountain ranges, their
sterile soil supporting only a covering of ling and heath.</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Coal Measures</span>; consisting of beds of Coal, with intervening
layers of shale, clay, and ironstone (see <a href="#Page_80">p. 80</a>).</p>

<p>6. <span class="smcap">Permian</span> and <span class="smcap">Triassic</span> strata (see pp. 29, 30).</p>

<p>The mineral substances found in the above strata in
Derbyshire are very numerous, and the organic remains
equally so, and of a highly interesting character.<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_804" id="Footnote_804"></a><a href="#FNanchor_804"><span class="label">[804]</span></a> A good, catalogue of the principal varieties will be found in
Mr. Adams&#8217;s pamphlet previously recommended; and specimens may
be obtained at his museum in Matlock, and from Mr. Tennant (Professor
of Mineralogy to King&#8217;s College), 149, Strand, London.</p></div>

<p>This enumeration of the geological formations of which
the country around Matlock is composed will enable us to
proceed on our rambles without further digression, and
should the reader be at a loss to comprehend the nature of
any of the rocks or strata we may meet with on our way, he
can refer to the above description.</p>

<p>Mr. Bakewell, with his wonted penetration, first detected
the true character of the stratification of the High Tor,
previous writers having described this cliff as being composed
of nearly horizontal layers. But this is a deceptive
appearance; for, although, when viewed in front, or in the
direction of their planes, the strata appear to be horizontal,
yet they are in reality highly inclined, as may be seen in the
line of dip, and enfold or envelope the back of the cliff; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_880" id="Page_880"> 880 </a></span>
they are continued into the hill (Masson) on the opposite
side of the valley, where they present a similar arrangement.
The continuity of the strata is broken by the vale of the
Derwent, which has evidently originated in a fissure extending
along the axis of elevation, in a direction from north to
south; thus forming the water channel for the drainage of
the country on the north, and the bed of the present river.
We have already pointed out the curved position of the
strata on the face of the <i>Church Tor</i>.</p>


<div class="sidenote">EXCURSION TO CRICH HILL.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Excursion to Crich Hill.</span>&mdash;The appearances observable
at the High Tor are of so striking a character, and involve
the consideration of so many interesting phenomena relating
to the physical mutations which this district has
undergone, that it is desirable, while they are strongly impressed
upon the mind, to take an excursion to Crich, a few
miles to the south-east of Matlock. Here there is an entire
mountain of limestone, formed by a protrusion of numerous
strata, many hundred feet in thickness, through the once
superincumbent beds of millstone grit and sandstone, into
a dome-shaped mass, upwards of 800 feet high. And there
it stands, a stupendous monument of one of the past revolutions
of the globe, with its arches of rifted rock, supported
by a central mound of erupted mineral matter, now cooled
down into an amorphous mass of compact basalt! Were
there no other object of interest near Matlock, Crich Hill
would alone render it worthy of resort.</p>

<p>From the heights above our hotel, looking towards the
south-east, a mountain remarkable for its elevation and
obtusely conical configuration, and distinguished by a tower
on the summit, forms a striking object on the horizon, at an
apparent distance of three or four miles&mdash;this is <span class="smcap">Crich
Hill</span>; and on the same range, to the right, is seen the
church-spire of Crich village (see <a href="#lign_272"><i>Lign.</i> 272</a>).</p>

<p>A long summer&#8217;s day is not too long to visit this mountain,
and examine all its interesting details. A good pedestrian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_881" id="Page_881"> 881 </a></span>
should proceed with his hammer and haversack, for
every step of the road is replete with interest; and as
numerous specimens will be obtained, bags, paper, and
boxes should be taken. If an invalid or ladies be of the
party, it will be desirable to have a carriage for the day,
and dine at the little village of Crich;<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> and, if time permit,
the interesting ruins of South Wingfield Manor-House (once
the prison of Mary of Scotland), about two miles from
Crich, may also be visited.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_805" id="Footnote_805"></a><a href="#FNanchor_805"><span class="label">[805]</span></a> A good, guide will be a great acquisition, and save much, time
and trouble; and <span class="smcap">Benjamin Froggatt</span>, who has conducted Dr. Buckland
and other geologists to the principal localities in the neighbourhood,
will be found an obliging and intelligent attendant, perfectly
conversant with the richest geological and botanical sites around
Matlock.</p></div>

<p>The shortest drive from Matlock to Crich Hill is over
Cromford-bridge; but a far more picturesque route is by
the Derby-road to Whatstandwell-bridge (see <a href="#lign_273"><i>Lign.</i> 273</a>),
and from thence ascending the hill to Crich, and returning
home by Holloway; making the entire distance about
twelve miles. As our immediate object is to examine the
geological features of the mountain, we shall proceed by the
nearest road; and upon reaching Scarthing Rock, turn to
the left, by Wellersley Castle grounds, having on the right
a bold escarpment of mountain limestone, with layers of
chert in nodules and amorphous masses. At Cromford
Canal, the limestone suddenly terminates, and sinks beneath
the surrounding alluvial silt of the river valley, and
the millstone grit. We will chip off a few specimens of the
chert, to examine at leisure. Crossing the bridge, the road
winds round the foot of the hills of sandstone, which lie on our
left, while on the right is the valley of the Derwent, and the
river is seen here and there through openings in the copses
and hedge-rows, meandering through the rich meadow-lands
of the valley, which are flanked on the west by a magnificent
range of lofty hills, clothed with the luxuriant woods
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_882" id="Page_882"> 882 </a></span>
of Alderwasley. The character of the scenery from this
point of the road, till we ascend the high ground, is faithfully
and graphically portrayed by Mr. Rhodes.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_806" id="Footnote_806"></a><a href="#FNanchor_806"><span class="label">[806]</span></a> Derbyshire Tourist&#8217;s Guide, p. 48.</p></div>

<p class="smaller">"The road lies through a beautiful valley by the side of the
Derwent; sloping meadows, crowned high above with a long range
of magnificent woods, skirt the road-side on the left: on the right
the river, pursuing its winding way beneath the umbrageous branches
of oak, ash, alder, hazel, and sycamore, and bubbling as it passes
along, is a beautiful object. About two miles below Cromford-bridge,
the road leaves the more open part of the valley, and plunges into
the thick woods that environ the little hamlet of <span class="smcap">Lea</span>; a lovely spot,
romantically situated by the side of a sparkling stream, in a deep
hollow, amongst steep hills covered with foliage, and fields of the
freshest verdure. The houses of this secluded village, with the exception
of here and there a comfortable cottage, are handsome residences,
nestling among orchards and parterres of flowers. Everything
was flourishing most luxuriantly; and when we passed through the
place, the hollyhocks, dahlias, and roses were in full blossom, and
gave an extremely bright and cheerful aspect to the scene. The road
continues through <i>Lea Wood</i> to <i>Holloway</i> by a very steep ascent, and
from the toll-gate at the top of the hill it traverses the side of a
mountainous ridge, covered with wood and intervening rock. The
prospect is now magnificent: on the right a scene of great extent
opens to the view, rich in all that constitutes the highest beauty in
landscape. The summits of the two ranges of hills that form the
eastern and western boundaries of the fertile valley at our feet are
here from three to four miles apart; and the extent from north to
south is from ten to twelve. Many minor eminences, rich with wood
and intervening verdure, adorn this enchanting scene, through which
the Derwent, sometimes hidden by overhanging trees, and sometimes
sparkling with light, flows with busy speed and uninterrupted current
by Belper, Milford, and Duffield, to Derby; the whole presenting
an assemblage of splendid scenery finely diversified and rich in picturesque
beauty. The woods of Alderwasley, that cover the hills
from below Whatstandwell-bridge, to the dark pine-crowned eminence
of <span class="smcap">Stonnis</span>, are peculiarly imposing and magnificent."</p>

<p>Near the village of Holloway there are several quarries
opened on the side of the hill, which enable us to ascertain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_883" id="Page_883"> 883 </a></span>
that this range is composed of strata of millstone grit and
sandstone, highly inclined and dipping from the hill. The
beds are so split and shattered in every direction, that no
large blocks can be procured, and the stone, although a
good building material, is therefore only employed in the
construction of the cottages and houses in the immediate
vicinity. The <i>vignette</i> of this volume represents a mass of
the inclined sandstone strata near this place. The reader
will recollect that the hills on the opposite side of the valley,
on our right, are also composed of similar strata; and that
the ridge, covered with fir-trees, marks the bold escarpment
of the millstone grit at <span class="smcap">Stonnis</span>, over Cromford; so that
the geological horizon of the valley, as seen from this spot,
is wholly formed by the millstone grits and sandstones.
A mile beyond Holloway toll-gate, the road turns to the
left, and the bare dome of mountain limestone of <span class="smcap">Crich
Hill</span> is before us. We soon arrive at a limestone quarry,
in which the strata are seen to be distinctly arched (see
<a href="#lign_271"><i>Lign.</i> 271</a>, p. 886), as in the cliff at Matlock <i>Church Tor</i>.</p>

<p>We will alight here to examine the rock more closely,
and obtain specimens. Here we see that the strata are
inclined both to the right and to the left, and also lean
towards the central axis of the hill in front of us; presenting
such an appearance as would be afforded by an
excavation made in an onion, or other spheroidal body,
formed of a series of concentric layers. The limestone in
this quarry is of the usual subcrystalline character, abounding
in shells, principally <i>Spirifer</i>. There are numerous
vertical and oblique fissures in the rock, and these are more
or less incrusted with minerals and spars, which have evidently
been deposited by electro-chemical action, and admirably
exemplify the manner in which the rich veins
of lead, &amp;c. are distributed in the strata of the interior
of the mountain. In a crevice of the rock, in which the
mineral contents were undisturbed, the arrangement of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_884" id="Page_884"> 884 </a></span>
prevailing minerals of this part of Derbyshire, namely,
galena (<i>sulphuret of lead</i>), sulphate of barytes (here termed
<i>cawk</i>), and fluor spar, was beautifully displayed. A layer
of the blue sulphuret of lead, or galena, was spread over the
surface of limestone forming the walls of the fissure: upon
this was a thick stratum of white sulphate of barytes; and
on the latter, fluor spar, of a light blue colour, forming
cubic crystals on the surface nearest the cavity of the
fissure, which therefore appeared to be lined with crystals of
fluor.<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_807" id="Footnote_807"></a><a href="#FNanchor_807"><span class="label">[807]</span></a> The workmen at this and the other quarries generally have
specimens of the fossils and minerals for sale, at moderate prices.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">TRAP OF CRICH HILL.</div>

<p>About half a mile beyond, we arrive at Wakebridge, near
which there are several very productive lead mines. The
"<i>Glory-mine</i>," one of the richest in Derbyshire, is said,
some ten years since, to have been worth from thirty to
forty thousand pounds a-year.<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> A mining establishment,
on the left hand, where a powerful steam-engine is constantly
at work, affords numerous specimens of the usual I
Derbyshire spars and minerals; and from among the heaps
of refuse thrown by the visitor may make an interesting
collection. Near this spot, a vertical shaft was sunk in the
side of the hill, in search for lead ore, and at the depth of
twenty fathoms, a rock of <i>compact Trap</i> was reached; the
work was continued for a few yards deeper, but ultimately
abandoned as fruitless. A gallery was subsequently driven
into the side of the hill, lower down, and here, too, the
trap was found; thus proving the existence of a central
protrusion of igneous rock, over which the bent strata of
mountain limestone are now disposed in consecutive layers.
Numerous blocks of this compact trap or basalt, some of
which are veined with red jasper, lie scattered about the
site of the old shaft, and an interesting suite of specimens
may be collected. Pursuing our way, the limestone strata
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_885" id="Page_885"> 885 </a></span>
are seen in openings on the hill side, having the same
remarkable arrangement as those before described.</p>

<p>Upon arriving where the road divides,<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> we must proceed
on foot and visit the quarries, and examine the exposed
masses of rock, that we may clearly comprehend the structure
of the mountain. We will now ascend by the pathway
that leads to the summit, and on the left several good
sections of the strata are displayed. On reaching the
tower on the crest of the mountain (<a href="#lign_272"><i>Lign.</i> 272</a>, p. 887),
a magnificent panorama bursts upon our sight; but which
no language can adequately describe. Here and there
bare pinnacles of rifted rock protrude through the green
sward; and masses of white, yellowish, and pink sulphate
of barytes, pyrites, fluor, and other minerals lie strewn upon
the surface.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_809" id="Footnote_809"></a><a href="#FNanchor_809"><span class="label">[809]</span></a> The carriage should here be sent on to the village, and orders

<p><a name="Footnote_810" id="Footnote_810"></a><a href="#FNanchor_810"><span class="label">[810]</span></a> Good specimens may often be obtained from the piles of stones,
and from the walls on the side of the hill.</p></div>

<p>Having reposed for some time at the foot of the tower to
enjoy the glorious prospect spread around us, correct our
notes, look over, trim, and wrap up our specimens, we will
now descend to the north-eastern side of the hill, that the
appearance of the strata on that aspect may also be
examined. But ere we leave the summit, again let me
call your attention to its external configuration. Were it
not on too extended a scale, we might suppose that we
were standing on an ancient earth-work, or encampment,
formed of limestone, surrounded by a deep fosse or ditch,
and flanked by precipitous embankments of millstone grit
and sandstone, so strongly defined are the physical features
of this remarkable mountain.</p>

<p>We will now visit a large quarry on the eastern side,
which presents a fine section of the limestone strata, above
100 feet thick (see <a href="#lign_271"><i>Lign.</i> 271</a>), and which, like those we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_886" id="Page_886"> 886 </a></span>
have previously observed, are disposed in curves, and enfold,
as it were, the central axis of the hill; and the rock is
shivered and fissured in every direction. A thick bed of
drift, or alluvial debris, covers the limestone strata, as
shown in <a href="#lign_271"><i>Lign.</i> 271</a>; and in it, partially rolled blocks of
sandstone, some of them of great size, are imbedded. The
direction of the dip of the strata in this quarry is indicated
by the arrows.</p>

<p>Let us now take a retrospect of the facts investigate
during this morning&#8217;s ramble, and consider how far Mr.
Bakewell&#8217;s interpretation of these phenomena (see p. 879)
is in accordance with the data we have obtained. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_888" id="Page_888"> 888 </a></span>
outline of Crich Hill, as seen from a moderate distance, is
that of an insulated oblong dome, encircled by precipitous
escarpments, or angular eminences of less elevation. The
annexed sketch (<a href="#lign_272"><i>Lign.</i> 272</a>), by my friend, Henry Carr,
Esq. C.E., of Duffield, to whom I am also indebted for a
survey of Crich Hill, and admeasurements of the dip of the
strata, will render this feature in the physical geography of
the country more apparent.</p>

<p class="smaller">In <a href="#lign_272"><i>Lign.</i> 272</a>, the protruded elongated cone of mountain limestone is denoted
by the tower, or <i>Stand</i>, on the summit; and the other heights, and the foreground,
are composed of millstone grit and sandstone. The highest point of limestone is
716 feet above the level of the Derwent in the adjacent valley; and was estimated
by Mr. Bakewell at about 900 feet above the level of the sea. The hill of sandstone
on the right, on which the mill stands, is 402 feet high, and conceals
Crich village in this view; that in the middle distance, on the left, marked <i>a</i>, is
400 feet high.</p>

<p>This disposition of the millstone escarpments around the
central cone of elevated limestone is shown more in detail in
the ground-plan, <a href="#lign_273"><i>Lign.</i> 273</a>.</p>

<p>Thus we perceive that the strata of mountain-limestone
dip from the centre of the hill in every direction, as indicated
by the arrows, at various angles, from 20&deg; to 50&deg;;
and those of the sandstone hills, which form an irregular
zone around Crich, are also highly inclined, and in like
manner dip from the central axis, as is shown by the
direction of the arrows. Now we know, by observations
made in places where the relative position of the Millstone
and Limestone has suffered no disturbance, that these two
series of strata were originally disposed horizontally and
conformably upon each other, thus&mdash;</p>

<p>It is therefore evident, that at Crich the strata No. 2
must have been forced up, and protruded through the
strata No. 1, or they could not occupy their present position.
We remarked, on ascending Holloway Hill, the great disturbance
which the Millstone beds had sustained (see the
vignette of this volume); and the shaft and gallery near
Wakebridge (<a href="#Page_884">p. 884</a>) disclosed the existence of a mass of
basalt, or <i>trap</i>, of unknown extent, beneath the limestone,
in the centre of the mountain; while the fissures and
crevices, filled with metallic ores and spars, attest the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_891" id="Page_891"> 891 </a></span>
action of intense heat, under great pressure. According to
a survey made by my son, a section in the line marked
A&mdash;B on the plan, <a href="#lign_273"><i>Lign.</i> 273</a>, presents the arrangement of
the strata seen in <a href="#lign_274"><i>Lign.</i> 274</a>: the heights are from actual
admeasurements.</p>

<p>From the data thus obtained, we may construct an ideal
section in illustration of these phenomena, as in the following
diagram (<a href="#lign_275"><i>Lign.</i> 275</a>).</p>

<p>Here then, as Mr. Bakewell forcibly observed, "we have
cause and effect in conjunction." Here is the cooled and
consolidated molten rock, whose expansive force elevated
the horizontal strata of limestone, and forced them through
the superincumbent beds of grit and sandstone. But this
eruption must have taken place under great pressure, and
at the bottom of the sea; for, had the phenomena been
sub-a&euml;rial, the result would have been altogether of a different
nature; and we should have had cooled lava streams,
and not masses of basalt.</p>

<p>We have seen that the strata rise round and enfold this
central nucleus of volcanic rock, displaying nearly hemispherical
segments and curves. Now if we suppose a vertical
transverse fissure across such a hill as that represented
in the diagram (<a href="#lign_275"><i>Lign.</i> 275</a>), the face of the remaining strata
would be in every respect similar to that of the <span class="smcap">High Tor</span>
(see <a href="#lign_270"><i>Lign.</i> 270</a>, p. 876); namely, a mass of <i>Trap</i>, or <i>toadstone</i>,
at the base, and a series of arched strata of limestone
above; with fissures containing ores of lead, zinc, barytes,
&amp;c. and various kinds of spar.</p>

<p>To a mind accustomed to investigations of this nature, a
slight examination of the phenomena under review will,
I apprehend, suffice to demonstrate the correctness of these
deductions; but I may have failed to place the subject
before the general reader in an intelligible and lucid point
of view; should this be the case, still, if the attempt to
present a familiar exposition of the physical structure of
this remarkable district shall induce him to visit the scenes
I have so imperfectly portrayed, and interrogate Nature in
a right spirit, the hours we have passed together in our
excursion to Crich Hill will not have been spent in vain;

<p class="smaller"><span class="smcap">Specimens of Fossils and Minerals.</span>&mdash;On our return, our first
care must be to look over all the specimens we have gathered,
arrange them, and select those which are the most illustrative of the
phenomena we have examined; and ticket every specimen, as recommended
in the Instructions. The fossils, consisting of several
species of <i>spirifer</i> and other brachiopoda, and of portions of encrinital
stems, require no particular care. The rocks should comprise
specimens of the different varieties of limestone and sandstone; and
of the green limestone, altered by contact with the toadstone; and
examples of the compact trap, and of the variety veined with red
jasper,&mdash;of the amygdaloidal toadstone,&mdash;and the vesicular, or that
in which the cavities are empty. The minerals should comprise the
ores of lead, zinc, barytes, fluor, and calcareous spar; of the last
some good clear pieces should be selected, that will exhibit its double
refracting property. Of the common metal, <i>Pyrites</i>, a few specimens
should be preserved; this mineral, from its splendid yellow appearance,
is often mistaken for gold; but a mere blow of the hammer
will immediately detect it, for <i>Pyrites</i> is brittle, and readily cracks to
pieces, while gold, as is well known, is remarkably ductile. If the
collector be not satisfied with the fruits of his day&#8217;s researches, he
should look over the catalogue of Mr. Adams, and purchase such
specimens as will render his collection sufficiently extensive to present
a full illustration of the geological character of the scenes he
has this day visited.</p>

<p class="smaller">There is a variety of sulphate of barytes from near Youlgreave
exhibited in the shops at Matlock, of which one or two examples
should be obtained. The surface of the polished specimens much
resembles the rich variegated appearance of dark tortoise-shell.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_894" id="Page_894"> 894 </a></span>
This mineral has been formed, like the common calcareous stalactite,
by infiltration through some porous rock; transverse sections exhibit
concentric layers of various shades; while the longitudinal have the
varied colours disposed like those in tortoise-shell.</p>

one day at least should be devoted to the examination of
the different localities pointed out in the following notes.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a>
To Cromford, and then take the road that leads through
<span class="smcap">Bonsal</span> vale. A fine range of limestone on the right, and
a sparkling stream (Bonsal-brook) on the left. On the
banks of this brook there is a manufactory of mineral
colours (Pooley&#8217;s) well worthy a visit. But before we reach
this establishment, there is an opening on the hill side
where the strata are exposed, and a bed of Trap is seen
beneath the limestone; near this place specimens of fluor,
calc-spar, &amp;c., that have been thrown out in forming the
excavation, may be collected. From beneath the trap a
warm spring issues and flows into the neighbouring brook.</p>

his guidance.</p></div>

<p>Proceed up the road leading to <i>Via Gellia</i>, and through
a valley flanked with high ranges of limestone and dun-stone.
On the right, is the beautiful cascade previously
mentioned, near <i>Dunsley</i>. This valley is a celebrated
botanical region, for several species of plants which are of
great rarity or unknown elsewhere are here met with. At
the direction post, turn to the left up the steep hill that
leads to Middleton Moor. On each side numerous fossils
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_895" id="Page_895"> 895 </a></span>
of the mountain limestone may be collected from the blocks
lying on the flanks of the hill. Views splendid in picturesque
scenery and of a highly interesting geological
character are obtained as we ascend. On the summit of
Middleton Moor, which is from 1,300 to 1,400 feet above
the level of the sea, a most extensive panoramic view of the
surrounding country may be obtained. The geological map
will enable the observer to identify the crags of Charnwood
Forest, the High Peak, &amp;c. &amp;c. Almost every part of the
Moor is studded with the disused shafts of exhausted mines,
and which are so carelessly covered over as to be extremely
dangerous, and the visitor must bear this caution in mind;
for the heaps of stone placed at irregular intervals on the
hill, and which tempt the geologist to seek for specimens,
are for the most part piled over the openings of deep
shafts.<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a></p>

which gave way under his feet, and suddenly disappeared in the

engulphed with masses of limestone in some deep chasm, and his
bones, incrusted with stalactite, form an ossiferous breccia, that in
future ages may perplex some collector of organic remains to determine
its relative antiquity!</p></div>

<p>Pass on by Worksworth, to the quarries of mountain
limestone, where the encrinital marble, so largely employed
for side-boards, chimney-pieces, &amp;c. is procured. Near the
approach to the entrance of the quarry, an instructive
example of curved strata of limestone is seen on the left;
and on the right, a fine vertical artificial section. On the
weathered surface of the left side of this entrance, and on
the face nearest the quarry, good specimens of the stems
I and ossicula of the usual Derbyshire crinoidea may be
extracted (<a href="#Page_284">p. 284</a>) from the layers of reddish limestone;
and good blocks of the marble may be selected. Large
spirifers can be procured from the limestone in these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_896" id="Page_896"> 896 </a></span>
quarries; the quarry-men often have specimens. On the
right hand of the entrance, layers of flinty slate (called
partings of <i>black bind</i> by the miners) occur between the
beds of limestone. In a field near this quarry, on the left
of the road leading to Cromford, where some mining operations
are going on, blocks of the stone called <i>chert</i> have been
thrown up, and often contain beautiful examples of the
pulley-stones (<a href="#Page_285">p. 285</a>), or siliceous casts of the stems of the
crinoidea. A large collection of fossils may be gathered in
the localities above mentioned.</p>

<p>We now drive to the escarpment of millstone grit at
<span class="smcap">Stonnis</span>, called <i>Black-rock</i>, whose pine-clad summit forms
so conspicuous an object in the view from Crich Hill; it
is about a mile from Cromford, and overlooks Matlock Dale.</p>

<p>On the right of the road, the refuse workings of a mine
cover the side of the hill; among which some specimens of
spars or minerals may perhaps be found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">VIEW FROM STONNIS.</div>

<p>But the grand attraction of Stonnis is the view of Matlock Dale and the surrounding mountains, obtained from
the verge of the precipitous escarpment of sandstone rocks,
under the knoll of pines. It is, indeed, a scene of transcendent
beauty and magnificence, and is said, by one who
has ascended every mountain top and traversed every ravine
and valley in this district, to be unrivalled.</p>

<p class="smaller">"In that species of beauty which in landscape scenery approaches

Masson, Crich, and Riber are all noble objects; and the rude masses
that constitute the foreground of the picture are thrown together,
and grouped and coloured in a manner strikingly picturesque. I have
scaled the highest eminences in the mountainous districts of Derbyshire&mdash;seen
from their summits the lovely dales that repose in H

<p>Every one possessed of taste and feeling who gazes upon
this glorious landscape will partake, in a greater or lesser
degree, of the emotions thus finely expressed by the ardent
lover of the sublime and beautiful in nature; but to the
natural philosopher the physical characters of this enchanting
region are fraught with a deeper interest, and present
subjects for the most profound contemplation. To him the
rocks and the mountains are the grand monuments of
nature, on which are inscribed the history of the physical
revolutions of the globe which took place in periods incalculably
remote and long antecedent to the creation of the
human race. They present to his mind a succession of
events, each so vast as to be beyond his finite comprehension;
ages of tranquillity, with lands and seas teeming with
life and happiness, succeeded by periods in which the earthquake
and the volcano spread universal ruin and destruction&mdash;and
they teach him that all these awful changes bear
the impress of the <span class="smcap">Almighty&#8217;s</span> hand, and were subservient

EXAMINE THE CENTRAL GROUP OF PLUTONIC ROCKS OF ENGLAND;
AND THE CARBONIFEROUS AND CAMBRIAN STRATA, THROUGH WHICH
THEY HAVE BEEN ERUPTED.</p>


<p>In the central county of our Island, within a hundred miles
of the Tertiary deposits of the South-east of England, a
group of plutonic rocks emerges from beneath the strata of
limestone, coal, and red marl which constitute the principal
geological features of the midland provinces, and rises up
into the bold and picturesque range of hills of <span class="smcap">Charnwood
Forest</span>. Almost the entire series of British rocks is now
brought by the railroads within a few hours distance of the
metropolis; and the geological inquirer may, in the course
of a fortnight, examine in their natural situations the
Eocene deposits of the London and Hampshire basins&mdash;the
Cretaceous and Wealden strata of Sussex, Kent, and Surrey&mdash;the
Oolitic, Liassic, Triassic, Permian, and Carboniferous
systems&mdash;the Mountain limestone and its metalliferous
treasures&mdash;Traps, or ancient lavas, and their effects&mdash;strata
of the Silurian and Cambrian systems&mdash;and, lastly, Granite,
Syenite, Porphyry, and other modifications of the plutonic
or igneous rocks. The present notes refer to two or three
days spent in exploring the country around Leicester, and
in examining the granite of Mount Sorel<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a>&mdash;the slate

coal-mines of Whitwick. On our previous excursion by
railway to Leicester (see Excursion to Matlock, p. 867), the
order of the succession of the strata from the metropolis to
that town was described; on this occasion it will only be
requisite to direct the traveller&#8217;s attention to the abrupt
isolated hills, by Hinckley, Grooby, and the craggy peaks
of Charnwood Forest, in the distance, on the left of the
railroad, before reaching Leicester. If a pedestrian excursion
be resolved upon, three or four days at least will be
required to follow the route presently pointed out; in a

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_900" id="Page_900"> 900 </a></span>
But this phenomenon is in accordance with what occurs in
other volcanic districts. For, as M. Constant Prevost
remarks, volcanoes may open across all the strata, without
occasioning great derangements; thus, at Limagne, Aurillac,
and Puy (see <i>Wond.</i> p. 269), the tertiary strata have preserved
their horizontality, even around the vents through
which issued the volcanic matter that covered those
countries with numerous cones of eruption.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">II. Mount Sorel.</span> <i>Granite and Syenite.</i>&mdash;The road
from Leicester ascends a ridge of Triassic or New Red
strata, called Birstal Hill, from whence there is a fine view
of the town. In the meadows on the left, some ruined
walls, covered with ivy, mark the site, and are the only
remains of the Abbey in which Cardinal Wolsey expired.
Approaching <span class="smcap">Mount Sorel</span>, an abrupt hill, with a mill on
the summit, denotes, from a considerable distance, the
geological character of the spot. There is a small Inn in
the village, where accommodation may be procured. Visit
the quarries, and also the establishment of Mr. Jackson,
where the granite is worked into pillars, side-boards, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_818" id="Footnote_818"></a><a href="#FNanchor_818"><span class="label">[818]</span></a> An interesting account of this manufactory will be found in
Sir Richard Phillips&#8217;s "<span class="smcap">Personal Tour</span>."</p></div>

<p>The hill is about 120 feet in height, and 1,400 yards
long; and is estimated to contain about two hundred
millions of cubic feet of workable granite, above the general
level of the district.<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_819" id="Footnote_819"></a><a href="#FNanchor_819"><span class="label">[819]</span></a> The granite resembles that of Aberdeen, but contains a larger
proportion of felspar.</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">III. Swithland.</span> <i>Slate-rocks.</i>&mdash;From Mount Sorel proceed
to Swithland: as we approach the quarries, the
employment of slate for every available purpose, in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_901" id="Page_901"> 901 </a></span>
footpaths, walls of cottages, &amp;c., indicates the abundance of
this material in the neighbourhood. At Swithland, the
quarries are very extensive, and expose magnificent sections,
from 100 to 120 feet thick, of strata of Slate, highly inclined;
and forming one side of an anticlinal axis, the
summit of which will be passed over in our route by
Woodhouse. In one quarry, at the time of my visit, a
series of nearly horizontal strata of red marl was exposed,
lying unconformably upon the edges of the highly inclined
beds of Slate. The Slate-rocks of Charnwood Forest have
a single anticlinal axis, which strikes from NN.W. to SS.E.;
and the axis of the adjacent coal-field of Nuneaton has a
similar direction.<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">WOODHOUSE. BARDON HILL.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">IV. Woodhouse.</span> <i>Slate-rocks.</i>&mdash;From Swithland to
Woodhouse, is a continuation of the highly inclined Slate
strata. The village is romantically situated on the ridge or
crest of the anticlinal axis of Charnwood Forest. On the
sides of the road, there are occasional openings where the
strata are exposed. There is, in particular, a fine section
on the sides of the elevated point on which the church
and school are built, lying to the left of the road in the
approach from Swithland. A day might be well spent in
this place, and at Swithland.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">V. Bardon Hill.</span> <i>Syenite.</i>&mdash;We next proceed to Bardon
Hill, ascending to the highest ridge of the protruded mass of
igneous rock, of which this mountain-range is composed.
The craggy and bare pinnacles which are every where presenting
themselves, shooting up, as it were, from the green
sward, cannot fail, from their novel and striking character,
strongly to impress the mind of the young geologist, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_902" id="Page_902"> 902 </a></span>
now, for the first time, visits a region of plutonic rocks.
The view from the summit of the hill is grand and imposing;
it should be studied with a geological map of the country
before us, that the position of this central mass of volcanic
rocks, and its relation to the surrounding sedimentary
strata, may be fully comprehended.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">VI. Whitwick and Snibstone.</span> <i>Coal-measures.</i>&mdash;Spread
around the foot of the Syenitic mountain which we are
descending are the coal-bearing strata of the Carboniferous
system; and in the works at <i>Whitwick</i> and <i>Snibstone</i> the
geological inquirer can examine the nature of these deposits
in the coal-mines, which he should descend, and obtain
specimens of the strata and fossils from the beds in
situ.<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_821" id="Footnote_821"></a><a href="#FNanchor_821"><span class="label">[821]</span></a> Should he be so fortunate as to see the resident engineer of
Snibstone Colliery, Mr. George Vaughan, he will be certain of
meeting with a courteous reception, and every facility for pursuing
his inquiries, descending the shaft, and obtaining fossils. Mountain
limestone is brought to this place to be converted into lime; and
good specimens of shells, encrinites, &amp;c. may sometimes be extracted
from the blocks of stone.</p></div>

<p>Among the refuse of the workings thrown up from the
various shafts, search should be made for stems of <i>calamites</i>
(<a href="#Page_108">p. 108</a>), <i>seed-vessels</i> (<a href="#Page_149">p. 149</a>), <i>fern-leaves</i> (<a href="#Page_109">p. 109</a>), &amp;c.</p>

<p>A section from Whitwick, through Charnwood Forest, to
Barrow-on-Soar, in the direction of the route we have
traversed, would give the following succession of rocks:&mdash;1.
Whitwick; <i>Coal-strata</i>, highly inclined. 2. <i>Slate-rocks</i>
of Woodhouse, highly inclined. 3. Protrusions of <i>Syenite</i>.
4. <i>Slate-rocks</i> of Swithland, highly inclined, with unconformable
strata of red marl. 5. <i>Granite</i> and <i>Syenite</i> of
Mount Sorel. 6. <i>Red marl</i> and <i>sandstone</i>, supporting the
<i>Lias</i>, at Barrow-on-Soar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_903" id="Page_903"> 903 </a></span></p>

<p>The pedestrian should spend one or two days at Snibstone,
where there is humble, but comfortable accommodation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARKFIELD AND GROOBY,</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
